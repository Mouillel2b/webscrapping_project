Service was polite, and the staff were clearly having a ball but probably weren't concentrating very hard on getting the food right.

I must say the beers served in here are really good ,light,hoppy and bursting with taste ,just so easy to drink ,it was just so good being in such a great tavern enjoying a really good beer and sat with my twin brother Stephen who is the best beer companion in the world.

985179467,"Expected a bit more from the reviews, place was full of students and tourists, doing a great trade but a shame the staff seemed overwhelmed and a bit unwelcoming. Ordered French onion soup and entrecôte steak. Soup was fine, a little thin, and missing a trick with the finish, felt more thrown together than as if made by someone who cared. Steak was underwhelming. Overcooked and not a very nice piece to begin with. Should not sell as entrecote - steak frites would be more accurate (expectation vs reality). If pitched as a homestyle meal in a fun and packed bistro it would be a great vibe and a hearty bite, but as it is positioned now it fell short of expectation. Not cheap eats either, but priced just right to appeal to international students and tourists, who we were surrounded by this night (we were contributing to the tourist quota). Good place to go for a quick eat if you are happy to lower your expectations a bit and can handle the touristic location and what that brings.

It's hard to come across restaurants that actually do Sichuan cuisine right like this. This actually tasted like home because my mom is from Sichuan and I've been there a lot of times. The dumplings kind of tasted like how my mom would make them too, it's amazing. As for the sheng jian bao's, I've never had them before even if I've been to Shanghai but what I can say is that they were also really good! They also do a fair amount of filling in the bao's unlike a lot of other places that are kind of stingy with the meat filling, so that's another good thing. The bao wrappers are thick enough to have a solid bite but not too thick, it was just right.

The atmosphere is very convivial sitting at comfortable high top communal tables in a small but brightly decorated room.  There is an intimacy as well because of the open kitchen where we can see the chef doing his own cooking.  The natural wines were chosen to compliment the meal.  As for the food, we were highly pleased as usual.  The meats and sauces always shine but an unexpected standout dish was the leeks served over a creamy cheese accented with Mr. Moreno’s house made salsa macha.  A perfectly composed plate!

The food was beautifully presented and the simplicity as well as complex flavors was an exploration of the various tasting buds woken up in the mouth. The service was impeccable. I would've given this restaurant a perfect 5 rating, but my one big complaint was our table. I did not like being squashed in the corner with an oddly placed lamp and side service table.

We entered the hotel and were unable to get anything in the garden room either so had to wait for 30 minutes in the lobby despite contacting various staff who were mulling around. This is poor for a hotel of this quality and guests expected to pay around €300 each for dinner.

This was a little strange as we had received an email the day before asking the same questions.

We tried several classic French dishes, including foie gras terrine, onion soup, duck confit, and sausage aligot. All the dishes were flavorful and decent, showcasing solid execution of traditional recipes. However, the food didn’t quite wow us, especially since we’d already enjoyed some outstanding French cuisine in the past few days.

The sauce was fantastic. It was very similar to a light au povie that is more typical with steak. It was a full quarter chicken. Sadly the breast meat was totally over cooked and dry. I did pack up half the pate in little baggies I carry. The left over chicken was so big and the wing looked really good that I asked about wrapping it up. They did so.

We had 2 burgers, 1 salad, 1 duck portion and 3 glasses of wine + one water. No doubt everything was from the freezer. Everything was burnt and not seasoned at all. To be honest, disgusting, no-one could eat a whole meal. 

When there was time to pay, they added random 25€ to the bill. We asked to see the menu and the receipt, there were way much more higher prices than in the menu!! We warned other tourists there.

I asked for a wine recommendation and were suggested with a bottle of low cost wine. I went along and ordered a bottle. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the wine! The wine had a full taste that stayed for a while. A lot better than the wine we ordered at another restaurant for almost double the price.

The personal were all somewhat sufficient in English. And even more importantly, it looked like they were having fun, having laughs with both the customers and each other. That caused a very inviting atmosphere to the whole place!

The place itself were quite lively. Not at all strict. Visitors at all the tables were having discussions, enjoying both the drinks and food.

915283144,"We visited 750g without booking after seeing excellent reviews on here. Upon arrival the restaurant was bustling, really busy inside and out, which is a good sign. We were unsure how to ask for a table, whether we needed to wait outside or go in and ask.. I went in while my wife stayed outside, and they spoke to her first. They asked us to find a table and would come over to bring a menu. 

We were served by around four different waiting staff through the evening, some with a better grasp of English than others, but they tried really hard and their efforts were appreciated! The drinks menu was extensive to say the least, so much choice! We opted to share a lovely bottle of rose, I had an additional cider (which was absolutely outstanding), and our son had a cola - please note they brew their own soft drinks, but he really enjoyed their version of a cola. 

The food menu was a large board that was brought to us by the waiting staff and talked through it. We pretty much had to decide there and then, as it wasn't left with us (and was absolutely massive, so it would've been in the way!). I had a steak, which was tiny, but well cooked. I was given possibly the bluntest steak knife I have ever used too! Both other mains were well received and enjoyed. For dessert my son and I opted for chocolate cake, which was a full pan of cake and a slice was taken in front of us for our meal. The chocolate cake seemed odd, possibly a dark chocolate cake, but unsure. My wife had the 'dessert with surprise', which she enjoyed.  

Not a bad price for the evening, with two courses each, a cola, a bottle of wine and a cider totalling around 75 euros. Very easy to get to from our hotel and even closer to the Metro. We left a tip when paying at the bar, to which they seemed very happy with and rang a little bell!

I ordered Pad Thai with chicken, it was delish, the only thing missing for me was some spiciness, but that’s because I love spicy Thai dishes.

But as soon as you pass the threshold of this quaintly charming place, you feel right at home and from the delighted faces of the patrons and the happy sound of the cutlery eagerly cleaning plates, you know you're in for a treat. 
The whole menu holds on the large slate conveniently put on display by the bon-enfant staff: three appetizers, three entrees and three desserts, which often change according to moods and availability of the freshest of ingredients, are expertly concocted and put together by a couple chefs. 
The four of us sampled the full content of the menu that day and swapped forkfuls of each other's plate for a full experience. From a small clam salad with citronnelle, mango and avocado, to a pig's feet terrine de Pieds de cochon with pickled young veggies and a fabulous gribbish sauce to a veal tartare with fresh figs, to stuffed rabbit, pork belly and trout filets. 
All dishes were uniquely spiced, perfectly cooked and tastefully put together. The desserts were equally fabulous.
A short list of carefully selected, uncommon (as in 'out of the beaten path') wines, completes this rich experience.

Most ingredients which have been ordered are forgotten by the waitress, or served when it is too late : when the main meal is eaten. I have to add that the service is slow. The portions of food are small. You are still hungry after eating the main meal. In spite of the small portions, your bill is not smaller.

The menu was small and simple. Examples: burrata with tomatoes, sliced salami and ham. Main courses were very few on the handwritten barely legible board. The steak of Charolais beef for 2 people was a kind of tomahawk cut. Although we ordered medium, it came absolutely “bleu”, i.e. raw on the table. On top of that, it was not aged, but tough and flabby.  Price: 98 €! The pork belly was probably reheated, a crust not present. It was black and soft and therefore inedible. The meat was very fatty on top of that. The fish dish was okay, but nothing special. The wine prices for a restaurant of this quality were definitely too high. An absolute nightmare.

931035769,"The worst service I've had in years! It was ridiculous how this restaurant kept taking guests even though the waiters/waitresses could not keep up. The food was very mediocre and wasn't even that good.  The waitress and waiter would literally throw your food down and then run away before you could even get a word out about what you needed.  Twice the table behind me was calling their waiter and he was so in a rush to leave, he didn't hear them.  I ordered a lamb kebab sandwich and some seafood pasta.  Firstly the kebab had a very small amount of tzatziki on it and so I asked for more. The waitress after 10 minutes drops some mayo off at my table. I put it on my lamb not knowing it was mayo when that was not what I asked for.  I gave it to the waiter and he snatched it without even asking what I needed, super rude. By the time I finally got the tzatziki, my lamb sandwich was cold and the lamb wasn't even that good, plus it was tough and unseasoned.  To top it off I received the bill and they had the nerve to charge me $7 (5euros) for the extra tzatziki after there was only a drop on my sandwich, just pathetic.  If you are near the Louvre and are hungry- run as fast as you can past this place. I made the mistake of stopping here because it was close to where I was visiting.  I would not recommend this place at all, so many other places that are much better to eat at rather than this place.",Worse Service Ever,1,Solo travel,1024651

The choice of dishes may not be that big, but there is more than enough variety for everyone to find something they want, and the execution is always great.

There is a good selection of banchan, regardless of your meal, all are very good. Meanwhile the bibimbap comes in the stone bowl and cooks at the table, which is surprisingly uncommon in Paris.

My fish was still raw in the middle in which I couldn’t even cut through with a steak knife that they gave me and my partners Burger was pink in the middle when we had specified for it to be cooked well done! 
I complained to the waiter and he sent it back with no problems but when I looked at my bf’s burger it put me off. I then quickly chased after the waiter to cancel my replacement order.
The manager then had the audacity to come and ask us why we didn’t want the burger anymore and suggested I should pay for it even though I changed my mind! 
It made us feel uncomfortable so we left our half drunken pints to pay the bill and it was 38euros for 2 50cl draught beers and a burger! Our beers were €10.60 each!! The most expensive beer we had in Paris! Even in a busy bar district we never paid that much! If you want bad service, undercooked food and expensive booze then be my guest! I will definitely not be returning!",Terrible,1,Couples,5260023

It is out of the way (might be a bit crazy to come here just for the restaurant) but if you’re around, it’s a nice place. Prices are slightly higher than usual (especially the Pajeon 15€). Dishes are minimum 15€. We had the bulgogi, the chicken, a bibimbap. The bibimbap was quite bland and did not have the crispy rice on the side (it was not served and maybe not cooked in the traditional stone dish). Other were nicely spiced, with quite a lot of pepper (so if you’re not a fan of pepper, might not be the place for you). There are no real desserts (2 options: ice cream and I don’t remember what else) but lots of different Korean drinks (especially alcoholic drinks). I’m not sure whether it is owned by a Korean, though the staff is Korean, the cooks are all Sri Lanka nationals. It’s good food, so i recommend it if you are ok with the price point and are in the area (if you accept to close your eyes on the fact that the cooks are not Korean of course.)",Good Korean food- a bit on the dearer side ,4,Family,6882071

The lady who served us was very friendly and we all loved it how she was smiling all the time and often checking if we are okay with the food and all.

They refused to even give me my invoice receipt after patiently waiting almost an hour to be attended to and after kindly (still) requesting for it. They only gave me a tiny strip of paper with numbers on it. The security officers at the exit point still used there bare hands to open my goods that I had bought and were going through my things and downloaded my invoice on their phones. I then requested for my invoice to be printed out. I complained that the staffs at the cashless section refused to properly help me, guide me, provide me my invoice that I requested and one of the ladies there that dressed and was shouting at me like a Dragon Queen was insisting that no one is here to assist OR guide me AND that I must do it on my own. But yet at the exit point, they were using there bare hands to disarrange, recalculate, explain to me what I bought AND downloaded my invoice on there respective phones. The most annoying thing is that at the cashless section, when I pleaded for help, one of the male staffs was claiming to be a ""new comer staff"" and was trying to learn his job. Whereas, when the security agents called him to the side, he was behaving and operating like an expert.

We are 3 Vietnamese who already lived in Paris for more than a decade and this was the first time we WERE TAUGHT how to behave by the lady owner of restaurant.
we were ready to order and we noticed that her took orders from the table sitting after us; so my friend raised his hand lightly and politely asked “auntie, can we order”; she came to us to complain and said it was rude to wave her, we just needed to sit and she would come. Also she said it was so “vietnamese” way to call a waiter and we have to LEARN how to do it in France; not forgetting to mention she has lived here since long time while she did not know we are locals in Paris as well. At least, we are all vietnamese and we were in a vietnamese restaurant !!!!
It is very annoyed when you pay to enjoy the restaurant and you are treated like the people with no education!

For food, clean/ cozy deco in a nice place but it is not really authentic and correct in taste. If you look for a french atmosphere with Viet cuisine (like us), it is a good choice; but if you wanna try an original taste of Viet food, so many other addresses in Paris , 13th district for example.

I am  a chef from New Zealand and having  once lived in Paris for 26 years let me share my wonderful experience from yesterday.This restaurant set in the beautiful park Buttes Chaumont is a real treasure. It is such a peaceful haven in the hustle and bustle of Paris with the impression one could be in the lush countryside with the awesome greenery and surrounding high trees (ceders of Lebanon). The service was very professional...the friendly and smiling waitress had even spent a year in NZ!.Patricia is the owner and she has done a superb job bringing together this young and dynamic team and amazing menu. The cuisine is very inventive,fresh, subtile and simply put divine! Your body will thankyou.,,,Bravo to chef Francois!",MAGNIFIQUE!!!,5,NONE,1819701

937041985,"There is an incomprehensible gap between reviews and actual experience.

There are so many better places in Paris, this one should be forgotten forever for the sake of all tastebuds. First, the imposed 5-course menu at 69 euros (wine pairing excluded) was, for lack of a better word, absolutely disgusting; like a child playing chef experimenting with flavors that should never ever have shared a plate. Everything was so overwhelmingly salty I could literally feel my blood pressure go up with every bite. The fish dish was grossly over-cooked, covered with raw mushrooms drowning in a random spice mix that could have come from tesco. The poultry dish was sitting in a random vinegar sauce that didn’t complement any flavor - it seemed like the chef had seen a recipe on a blog and failed to reproduce it. I returned all my plates uneaten and nobody came to check why or offer an alternative.

Then there was the waiter, Federico, who acted like he was on some kind of chemically-induced trip the whole time, completely unable to read or pick up any social cues from customers. I now see that he’s mentioned in a number of other reviews for his surprisingly agressive rudeness.

At the end of the meal I asked to speak to someone, the chef / owner Michael came up; I politely said that I wasn’t able to eat anything because of the (paraphrasing) heart-attack inducing sodium content. The chef said defiantly : “I saw that, but everybody else liked it, so your taste is the problem”.

Taken aback, I asked if he intended to present me with a 70 euro bill given the fact that I hadn’t eaten anything, as he had seen. He responded “Well, of course. This is how restaurants work”. I said that, unsurprisingly, this wasn’t my first time in a restaurant and that at that price level you’d expect someone to check on you if you returned a full dish. He said that he was aware I didn’t like it, and his waiter had checked on me - he hadn’t, he’d simply said “ok” and taken the plates away.

I attempted to interject with a comment that the waiter had been particularly unpleasant all evening, which then prompted the waiter to jump in and scream - and I kid you not - that I had “raped him by asking his name and introducing myself at the beginning of the meal”. You literally couldn’t make this up.

So here I am, out 70 euros, with an empty stomach, nightmarish memories of Frankenstein dishes that should never have seen the light of day, and an accusation of “rape” (his literal words) because I introduced myself to the waiter.

Hopefully my experience can save others the misfortune of crossing paths with the chef’s equally terrible food and attitude; then the 70 euros I spent on breathing this restaurant’s air tonight wouldn’t have been completely lost.",Avoid. There are a lot of better places.,1,Friends getaway,8660058

902003010,"Our tourgroup came by to this Chinese restaurant located in the city center of Paris and it's quite a popular restaurant as we saw the restaurant was almost full house!

We were led to the 2nd storey by the friendly staff where we occupied several tables. The ambience and decor were very Asian, with the nice paintings

Could not remember exactly how many dishes were (around 5~7), that consisted of soup of the day (sour soup), stir fried vegetables, deep fried chicken, sweet and sour pork, egg omelette and cut fruit. The portions were large. And they only serve drinking water and great if they can serve Chinese tea to blend with the theme of the restaurant

Overall, the foods were nice and quite authentic Chinese taste, although the veggies were a little bland and the chicken a little too salty. But if you have them with rice, it's ok.

Service staff were efficient too in clearing used plates. And when we left, the boss who was stationed on the ground floor, greeted and thanked us for coming.",Overall nice Chinese food in Paris! ,4,Couples,2417807

After my family also finished eating, he even said get out to us because another customer wants to come in, WOW. ""Get out, get out now"" said by him with rude tone.
I NEVER EVER GET this kind of attitude from any restaurant. When i told him you're being rude, he said ""I'm the bos of this restaurant so get out quickly."". The heck? I don't care if you are the bos.

But I was with customers and they needed a bathroom break and wanted a cup of tea. I knew that their 5 euro cup of tea was already outrageously overpriced but I figured it shouldn't cost more than 7 or 8 euros for a glass of wine. Well, was I wrong. It was 11 euros for a miniscule glass of red wine, which I'm sure the owner has obviously taken great care to inform the waitstaff not to give you even a millimeter more than the tiny little line on the glass. The servers were also unfriendly and didn't care but that's likely because they're working somewhere where the customers are going to hate them. If I could have cared more I would have told the waitstaff loudly, in English (I can speak and write in French but I hated this place so much that I won't even do them the honor of speaking and writing in French) what absolute jerks they were but they obviously wouldn't have cared. I've lived in Paris for years so I know when you're in a touristy area you pay more and I'm fine with that. But this was just way beyond anything that even the worst tourist deserves in terms of price and unfriendly service. 

I officially designate Les Bons Garçons as a huge turd sandwich and I hope and pray that their business fails sooner rather than later because the owner is obviously just a greedy troll who is looking to rip people off. You would have to look hard to get more ripped off anywhere else in Paris. Again, I blame myself for not asking about the price of a glass of wine before ordering but I just could not imagine that a tiny, little, itsy, bitsy, teeny, weeny smaller than any glass of wine I've ever ordered in Paris could possibly cost 11 euros. Yes! 11 euros for the tiniest glass of lousy wine in Paris.

As for water, they won't offer you tap.  They will only offer sparkling or still. They brought large bottles of water at no cost to the locals but I watched them charge tourists over and over again.  When I called them out on it they pretend they don't understand what they did wrong.  I said they didn't offer an option of tap and they say of course they did!

We told our hotel concierge we wanted a French restaurant, preferably where we could dine outside.  He recommended A Mi Chemin and we were thrilled.  The restaurant is very casual.  Most of the clientele are neighborhood people stopping in for a bite on their way home from work.  Definitely not a touristy restaurant.  The outside seating is on the front sidewalk, so you have a birds-eye view of Parisians coming and going, there is a fruit stand and fresh fish being sold across the street as well as residential housing.  
Two of us ordered escargot as appetizers and it was possibly the best I've ever had - especially when you dip that delicious crusty French bread into the garlicky sauce. Our waiter didn't speak a word of English but that didn't stop us from communicating.  He pointed out recommendations on the menu (which was thankfully in English) and everyone loved their meal.  And in our little group this is not usual since the guys are fuss-pots and generally prefer dining out in Brooklyn (Italian) restaurants.  We were all so full by the end of the meal all we could manage was sorbet and coffee for dessert.  But if return some day, I'll be sure to leave room for some of those awesome desserts.  The final bill for the 4 of us was somewhere around $200, including drinks, appetizers, entrees, dessert and coffee and one of the best experiences we had on our 10 day European vacation.

196034772,"In my experience, this is one of the best Japanese restaurants I have come across in Paris, and I make a bee-line for it every time I stay in the nearby Ibis Alesia-Montparnasse, Paris 14eme...it's my favourite restaurant in the area. (It is also known as ""TOKYO"" Delices d'Asie.) 

The place is also well frequented by the locals, and I have eaten there myself regularly over the past few years, always finding its high standard maintained. 

Also, due to her outrageous comments, I can only assume that ""Salome 1345” was reviewing another restaurant, or perhaps works for a rival business (a common occurrence on Tripadvisor sadly), hence my motivation to put the record straight by writing this review!

Tokyo offers delicious fresh food at an incredibly reasonable price. My favourite meal, and also highly recommended, is a fixed-price menu (menu 5, Maki Brochettes) that includes a bowl of miso soup, followed by a refreshing cabbage ""salad"" (a bit like coleslaw, only tastier), followed by 6 pieces of sublime California Maki (which I recommend dipping in the ""sauce sucré""), and the final course is a bowl of rice with 4 Yakitori/brochettes (mini kebabs): melted cheese wrapped in a wafer thin slice of beef, chicken thigh, chicken wing, and chicken meatballs...all mouth-wateringly delicious. All that for 12.50€! The house wine is good value too: 50cl costing less than 5€. I normally dine alone, but once there with my partner, the meal for the two of us, plus half a litre of Rosé wine, came to just under 30€. We'd have happily paid double that to get as good a meal, and in the UK that's probably what I would have to pay, if only we could find a decent Japanese nearby, like Tokyo. My partner was so impressed (and it takes a lot to impress him), we ate there twice in 4 days.

Also, if you are a bit of a novice when it comes to Japanese food, as I was once, French Japanese restaurants have this lovely habit of printing appetising photographs of the various dishes on offer, which I find definitely helps you in making your choice. 

The service, too, is very efficient, possibly too efficient, in that if I am eating alone, I can be in and out in less than an hour! But as I am often in a hurry, that suits me fine. 

I'm surprised Tokyo has not received further praise from Tripadvisor fans, so I can only assume that those of us ""in the know"" have preferred to keep it quiet, otherwise if it became too well known, we would not be able to get a table there ourselves!

Lovely carrot soup, and then a nicely cooked and flavored steak, followed by 2 yummy and interesting deserts. The service was also great. We enjoyed it so much we decided to make a reservation for dinner a couple days later. 

Our dinner experience was not ideal and left us rather frustrated. We made a booking because it is a smaller place. The older gentleman (owner maybe?) offered us a table by the bathroom, we politely asked if we could sit at another table. He responded by aggressively slamming the menu on the table and basically throwing a bag of bread at us. Now, I don’t want to be another American complaining about French service. But my partner visits Paris often and we both speak enough French to greet, small talk, read the menu, and order, all in French. We felt this man was just overly aggressive with us. We ordered a bottle of wine and all he did was open it and put it on the table for us, no standard taste pour or anything. The food for dinner was not nearly as good as lunch, maybe it was a different chef. I had some rather bland scallops and extremely bitter endive that was only remedied by lots of salt. My partner had veal that was less than exciting as well. Was just rather disappointing dinner overall after having a nice lunch, especially since we paid about 3x what we paid for lunch. Also, it seemed like the older gentleman had a party in there that he knew, and another women (wife maybe?) was going back and forth eating and enjoying, and then helping herself behind the bar.

The karaage was light, crispy and not greasy. The agedashi tofu was excellent. The miso eggplant really grew on me. Never had anything quite like it before. Half an eggplant baked with miso glaze on it. You can get the soba hot or cold with various additions. The hot broth was clean but super flavorful. 

The mochi was solid. You only get 3 half pieces though. Matcha, black sesame, and one other flavor I couldn't quite place. The creme brulee was excellent. A hint of sesame.

So I was just walking around, walked across the Seine and found this little Chinese restaurant. I find it very interesting that they heat your food in a microwave. I was the only non-French speaking person ordering at the restaurant, so I had to use my creativity to effectively communicate with the two ladies behind the counter.

I had a platter of cheese and meats which was served with a little salad and bread.  Only criticism was there was too much! The missus had burger and chips and enjoyed that very much too.

Then the following day we had further drinks and an evening meal - we chose the club sandwiches as we'd eaten in the centre of Paris at lunchtime - but the double decker toasted sandwiches were served with chips and salad too so not in any way a lighter snack!

The service is classic Parisian rudeness, which is so downright despicable that you may attend here for comedy value alone. The young lady that served us hated every minute of it. She was actually acting like she was doing us a favour in serving us at all. 

The restaurant was not busy and everything took a really long time and she was clearly struggling with a lack of motivation to do anything at all. 

It’s a shame because the steak and potatoes dauphinoise were really good and good value for money, too. But in this day and age a customer does not have to put themselves through such an ordeal to get a meal, surely? 

It does surprise me that return custom is not at the forefront of the mind of the owner because we happily took our business elsewhere...","Food was good, service well below despicable",2,Solo travel,952073

Decor needs improvement as we does not feel very upscale and they need to do something about their toilet. Very basic and no handtowels and also… not very clean.

The 11 euro 2 course lunch is a steal!  The food is imaginative, fresh and tasty. We had spring rolls ( not in pastry but more of a wrap) followed by caramel pork with sticky rice.  If this was down the road from me at home I would go every week.  
If you go on bus 69 from Central Paris get off at the stop just at the end of Rue roquette and the bar is across the road on the left.  The cemetery is a 3 minute walk further on.

730172140,"We came to the Atelier du Parc for a work dinner between colleagues as they said they were more than able to accomodate a larger group with specific food requirements. This wasn't entirely true.

Parking and access were a disaster because of traffic associated with the Parc des expositions opposite. Unless you are using public transport, accessing the restaurant is difficult.

Our table for 8 was a three different 2 person tables stuck together, it looked pretty absurd. We were mostly ignored while they served the even larger group table next to us. Served their entire meal before we'd even received our starters. The restaurant seemed completely unable to deal with the number of diners, we arrived before 8pm, our amuse bouche was served at 9:15pm, our starters at 9:38pm and the main after 10pm. I find this pretty unacceptable.

The food itself wasn't much to write home about (and consider that I was starving at this point and ready to eat anything). The amuse bouche was tuna but we were not warned, so I had the little anonymous soup. The langoustine ravioli didn't have a distinct langoustine taste and 3 ravioli for 19€ seemed steep. The beef main was good if unoriginal. Meanwhile the apple tarte tatin dessert was a failure for me : no distinct flavours, the pastry texture was too soft and the choice of plates inadapted, so I chased my ice cream around the plate, it melted because the plate was hot and I basically didn't get any on the spoon.

All this for 50€ per person without wine. What a joke. ",Significant room for improvement ,2,Business,1165395

331121356,"We first visited this little jewel of a place in 2013, shortly after it had opened.  We were recommended by Australian friends who told us of the owner and chef who combined a career in the French wine industry with a passion for menus that used seasonally available food.   We visited twice in 2013 and twice again in 2015 – lunch and dinner each time to get a good grasp of the culinary style.  There were some dishes that looked quite sophisticated to us, so we were glad that the charming hostess spoke perfect British-accented English – she is usually on duty towards the end of the week we were told.  We were very happy with her wine recommendations – with the added benefit of an opinion from Monsieur le Chef who also has excellent English.  This gave us confidence to explore a little beyond our comfort zone – none of that awkwardness when you are not quite sure what is being offered.  The restaurant is also a cave (bottle shop in Australian terms – wine only though) with two walls of wines displayed with prices marked - so no surprises!  A feature was that we were able to take home with us the balance of the white and red wines that were paired with our dishes, rather than restrict ourselves to the by-the-glass list.  A lovely way to reflect on our visits the day after.

This is an intimate little restaurant – maybe 25 to 30 plates – with a blackboard menu that is brought to the table for discussion which made asking questions a comfortable experience.  Seating includes a refectory table that offers 8 – 10 places where, in a warmly cross-cultural experience, we shared a little in the politely convivial company of six other diners at a lunch last September. 

Over the two years and four visits that we have made, the quality of food and service at “the red apron” has continued to develop while the prices for our meals made for very good value for money at 18-19€ for lunch and 34-35€ for dinner.  Highly recommended for those searching for a “real” Parisian restaurant, very much a venue for locals and well off the tourist track, but where we nevertheless felt special and warmly welcomed.","The perfect blend of food, wine and service – a “real” Parisian restaurant that locals use",5,Couples,2721877

945213029,"Normally, this would be an easy 5/5, but considering our meal was ~$800 for two, the standard for a 5 gets moved higher. 

Restaurant (5/5): really top dining room. It is very comfortable and beautiful. The elevator ride to the dining room is also a nice touch. We came in March so it was too cold to leave the roof open, but I would imagine that in the spring or summer that is a really neat experience as well. There was a screaming child (not baby) for half our dinner: one-off event so not knocking any points here, but hyper annoying at the price point. Should really only be 18+ or maybe 16+ allowed here. 

Service (3.5/5): the service is very formal so you have relatively little interaction with the waiter (we also did the tasting menu, so it was preset) which is okay and the coordination was really perfect and professional; however, for $400 a person in Paris, we would hope for more English speaking. I hate to give that comment, but really even in cafes and bakeries the English was much much better. Considering we were doing a menu with a wine pairing, we would hope to get an explanation of the courses and wines, but these were half mumbled and skipped over due to the language barrier. Again, I wouldn’t knock this if it was even $150 a person. But at $400 you expect at least somewhat bilingual wait staff. 

Food (4.5/5): again, value. The taste was excellent and all was perfectly prepared. However, at this price point you would hope for slightly more food, or perhaps one less course and the others slightly more. Particularly at the end there were 2-3 very small dessert type courses that perhaps could have been bigger or combined.  Regardless, food was excellent. 

Overall, it’s a unique and amazing experience and I would recommend going to see it, but I’m not sure I would go back a second time given the above. Still, it’s a place that if you are willing to pay the experience is truly unique.","Excellent, but not sold on value overall",4,Couples,780426

And that's fine. Because Cartet is a secret society, a mystery restricted to insiders.
I used to live next door and Cartet was my reward. 25 years ago. 
For my last visit I found the same panelling, the same sofa, the same empty tables. The same silence. Over the years the tiny restaurant had kept old-world charm of the past, golden years memorabilia. Like my granny music box. 
The chef-owner had prepared terrines platter, cod brandade, stiffly beaten egg whites. He proposed a Chateauneuf du Pape. Like it was before. Simply perfect.

241577517,"Where to begin?  This was a memorable meal; good, enjoyable, wildly overpriced and completely unforgettable in its eccentricity.  

Cartet carries a legendary name, a once celebrated female-run bistrot which changed hands 12 years ago.  The current owner/chef/waiter/reservationist/doorman/
sommelier/dishwasher took it over then, maintaining many of the classic dishes.  But the similarities stop there.

There is a name on the awning, but in the windows flanking the door meant to hold menus, or anywhere else is there any evidence it is a restaurant.  Including the locked door.  As we began to turn away despite a reserved table, it was unlocked for us, then relocked, lest some unreserved guest have the temerity to try for a table.  One older couple and a table set for two reserved for us.  The other 18 places empty.  When asked, the chef replied that he serves “as few as he can”.  

He was charming, friendly and everywhere at once, doing everything.  The menu is broader than one would expect for four covers, and not everything was available.  This isn’t exactly a private chef, but neither did it evoke the awkwardness of an empty restaurant waiting for guests.  It was unusual, as in never before, but fun.  Again?  Probably to show off, but we’ve seen the film.

Food
Terrine for every table.  Fresh and good.  Magret, thinly sliced with orange sauce, veal chop with morels in cream sauce.  Both served with a double portion of irresistible potato cake.  Entrees, salade with lardons, morels (again) on toasted brioche with a different cream sauce.

Desserts:  All of them put on the table:  chocolate mousse, lemon tart, rice pudding, floating island, flan…

Service
Gracious and personal

129511578,"This tiny restaurant near Place du Republique may be one of the best finds in Paris. On our second visit today, we had the restaurant to ourselves.  We were served by the chef/owner who was also tending the kitchen.  Had I not called last week and requested a reservation he would not have been there.  He opened just for us. We had a superb salade avec noix, my wife had magret du canard orange, and I had leg of lamb.  All the dishes were outstanding and accompanied by a couple of nice glasses of pinot noir.  The chef mentioned to us that Hollande, the just elected President of France ate at the same table where we were seated a short while back.
This place is a real find and I suspect very few tourists ever find it, or if they do they don't get in.

I wanted to try another restaurant in Cheval Blanc Hotel during my recent trip to the city. I therefore went to Le-Tout Paris for dinner on a Sunday.

I ordered:
- onion and agarics soup 
- grilled blue lobster with béarnaise sauce 
- mashed potato with fried capers 
- millefeuille.

The dishes didn’t wow me. However, all of them were made with very fine and fresh ingredients, correctly executed and delicious. 

I initially didn’t intend to have any dessert since I was already quite full. But a very friendly male staff highly recommended their millefeuille and said it’s very light. He didn’t lie. The puff pastry was very light and thin and it’s one of the best millefeuilles I’d had for quite some time.

In addition to the good food and professional service, I also enjoyed a very nice view of the Pont Neuf and the Seine. 

The meal, which finished within 2 hours, was a good respite after 5 long and filling dinners in some gastronomic restaurants in the city. The experience didn’t come cheap but I certainly got what I paid for.

155841154,"We were drawn in by the reasonable prices and the chance to try some cuisine we've never had - this restaurant specializes in food from Reunion Island, off the coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. Very similar to Creole food you'd find in the French West Indies. We had the curried fish, and it was very tasty, but not like curry you'd expect from India. It was more like the ""Columbo"" sauce you find in Guadeloupe, or even Puerto Rico. We also had the fish ball appetizer, which was spectacular.
Decor was kind of shabby, but ultimately the service was decent, the food was good, and the prices were very reasonable. We were the third couple in the door at around noon, but by 12:30 the place was completely full of locals. 
We say difficult to review, because if you're looking for gourmet, or ""cute"", or romantic, or something typically French, then you may be disappointed. But if you want to try something out of your comfort zone, and you don't have a big bankroll, then ultimately you should enjoy your visit.

I'm a fan of couscous, and this seemed like a typical neighborhood spot.  I was expecting a decent couscous, which would have been very satisfying.  Instead, I had a fabulous meal with boulettes (beef-lamb meatballs), attended by a friendly waiter (the owner, maybe?).  

There are maybe a dozen choices of accompaniments, and I had the ""boulettes""version,  which are three beef-lamb meatballs. This was more than enough, because you get the semoule, the chickpeas, golden raisins, the broth with traditional vegetables, and with this order, the boulettes. This is one of the smaller choices, and I finished about half to 2/3. I wanted to try the Royal, but it would have been enormous, and I hate to waste food. Oh, even the harissa tastes home-made and is delicious. 

The place was empty, just myself and one other client, because this was during the ramp-up of the national restrictions being applied in France to meet the impending coronavirus situation spreading in Europe, and staring in France. While ordering dinner, he told me that all restaurants in France were closing at midnight, and while my French is pretty good, I simply thought I had misunderstood. While eating, a cabinet minister was on the TV, announcing the shutdown of all non-essential activities in France, including restaurants and bars, to begin in just three hours.  I couldn't believe my ears. That gave an added significance to my meal, which was heavenly. It was hard to imagine it closing for the foreseeable future, and how the country would cope. (I ended up flying home, to the first city in the country to order the same restrictions as in France, effective two days after.) Anyway, I've made note of Icosium, and will definitely come back, and bring friends.  I've already recommended to one francophone group I'm involved with back home.

As soon as we entered the door we could feel a not very pleasant atmosphere. We were given a table and while we were waiting a waiter came twice to take our order and just left mid sentence without an apology or explanation. He only came back to us when we got up to leave because we were fed up with what we considered his strange and unprofessional behaviour. We then had to wait about 25 minutes for our meal.   And the place was not comfortable for relaxing. I must say the quality of the Lamb I had chosen  was very good but it was ridiculously over spiced, over salted and over peppered. So all in all a very disappointing meal. Because of the bad service we did not have what normally is my favourite part of a meal - the desert!!   As I said earlier the atmosphere was not very nice either. It did seem to be busy perhaps with locals.

We were the only ones there for lunch on a Wednesday (during the school semester break), so we hope it’s busier at other times, and that they do well.  After reading “recent” (post-May) reviews, however, that might not be the case.  We enjoyed our cassoulet (though there wasn’t as much liquid as in the past), foie gras, and caramelized apple dessert — and found the service friendly and helpful.  We hope the nieces and staff can emulate Olivier’s charm and rapport with customers and maintain food quality of the past — and survive. We loved Thomieux for Southwest cuisine for years, and later Au Petit Sud-Ouest, but both were sold to new owners who changed their character and cuisine.

728718317,"On my last night in Paris, a Sunday when many restaurants are closed until Tuesday, I chose to dine at Pierre Sang's flagship restaurant fittingly named ""Signature."" This was an absolute fabulous dinner in a small, chic space, not much bigger than the open kitchen.

Our server Anatole, was professional and informative, handling dozens of my questions with aplomb.  Signature does not have a Michelin star.  Certainly, an utter surprise, since the food and service were Michelin quality, and well respected critics in Paris have showered Signature with praise.  It may be because the kitchen is run by a rotating team of chefs, something Michelin doesn't like.  Favoritism is shown to chef driven restaurants and kitchens.  Michelin does what Michelin wants.  However, don't allow the lack of a Michelin star to deter you from visiting Signature.  Our dinner was scrumptious.

Pierre Sang owns and has mastery over three restaurants within shouting distance of each other in the northern reaches of the Eleventh Arrondissement, not far from the nightlife on Oberkampf. The two other casual joints are very popular with the denizens who enjoy the bars and clubs in this neighborhood.  Signature is a destination restaurant, very different from the other two

Our 6 course set dinner was complex, innovative, and so difficult to describe.  It was right up there with one of my best meals in Paris.  The room holds about ten tables and personal attention is assured.  The price of  69 Euro, was rather reasonable for this amazing food.  There are two sittings I believe, 7:00 and 9:00, but that may be wrong.  Have dinner here on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday and then hit the nightlife of the 11th and 20th a few steps away.  I think that would be a perfect evening.",A Special and Intimate Dinner,5,Friends getaway,13625754

We'd had dinner at the Oberkampf restaurant a couple of nights before, and after our experience, we cancelled reservations at a more renowned restaurant to spend a night here with a different menu. 

We sat at the bar and talked with the chefs during our meal. I'm sure they would have left us to be if we'd wanted that, but we wanted to talk and ask questions and they were extremely hospitable. 

The menu had a much more Asian feel than the neighboring Oberkampf restaurant on the corner, and started off with a couple amuse, then started with a resounding success of a scallop crudo. The Asian herbs, citrus, and sauces used throughout the service gently pushed the food into unique territory, offering a truly new taste in Asian French fusion. Plates were artfully arranged and sparse, but the flavors were what truly made the dishes sing.

Look for a side streets and walking in the block around the Madeleine Church we found this little restaurant glimmering at the end of the street (which really was not the end of the street as it just made a minor bend at the restaurant).
Looking in from the outside gave us second thoughts. We saw a very small bar with a few tables. But we decided to give it a try. And the bar was really small, and crowded but the restaurant was beyond the bar.
Mmm... looked a bit scruffy but that was only staging. At the center of each table was a QR-code with the menu. And it was also to be found on a giant chalk board for us not so handy with the phone.
 Suspicion still hold its grip but when the food arrived it shattered as the food, with generous serving, were exceeding all expectations. Steks cooked to perfection and perfect fries.

621122313,"On our one Friday night in PAris, we unfortunately got a late start for sinner. As a result, many of the restaurants along Blvd Montparnasse were filled. We stopped at a liquor store in search of a particularly liqueur and asked the clerk for recommendations. He suggested a couple of places but when I mentioned Bleu Grill Francais, he shook his head and said to stay away. We ended up there anyway because his suggested places were full.

Alas, the clerk in the liquor store was right. This place was awful. I had Lemon Sole with a salad and rice pilar. When it arrived, the server managed to bury his thumb in my bowl of rice pilaf as he shifted plates around the very small table. The fish was overcooked in some places and seemed undercooked in others. The rice pilaf wasn't even warm. My companion had beef which should have ""melted"" in his mouth but from the vigorous chewing I saw across from me, I could tell that the meat was of poor quality.

They say that locals know the best places to eat and a local tried to steer us clear of this place. We didn't listen and paid the price with what was easily the worst meal of my 10 days in France.",We should have listened!,1,Friends getaway,15133317

So we decided to go for dinner last night. Unfortunately it was disappointing. The menu is different and very restricted in the evening so we were forced to choose the full vegetarian menu at 42€ EACH, and as we wanted to have lamb that was an extra 50€+. It was copious for two but overpriced.The vegetarian menu was good, but consisted mainly of different dishes of sweet potato and butternut, and the lamb was served in a pumpkin… so everything tasted kind of the same. The way the food was served was very theatrical and pretentious. The restaurant should have sufficient confidence in its food not to have to rely on such gimmicks. Ora Farmhouse calls itself « bucolic », but to tell the truth, in the evening the vibe is more night club than farmhouse, because of the loud music and the karaoke upstairs.

I will admit that sometimes the menu is limited or lost without a strategic vision.

Compared to typical hotel restaurants, the food at breakfast, lunch and dinner ranges from very good to excellent. 

If I had a complaint it's breakfast. The buffet is extensive and having the option of fresh cooked eggs is great. However, as an American I'm not used to eating food that sits on an open buffet at room temperature for a prolonged period of time. Also, some customers are not careful either in what they touch and shouldn't touch or how they handle the food to avoid cross-contamination. 

The hotel restaurant really shines at dinner. 

While there is a bar menu, the food on the restaurant menu is worthy of a Michelin rating. The quality, taste, plating and presentation are superb. 

If you're staying at the hotel be sure to make a reservation for dinner through the concierge as the hotel offers a complimentary glass of wine as an incentive. That's a nice way of subtly encouraging guests to eat at the hotel.

First of all, the deco is really fun and even the toilet is fully decorated (with a whole Frida Kahlo temple I love it). They also have various cocktails and drinks on the menu and the atmosphere is just really nice overall!
Food wise, I ordered guacamole and chips as appetizer and I did like that one. It was really fresh and there were 2 kinds of chips which was interesting. Then I ordered beef tacos which I really looked forward to, but sadly the tortillas were hard. Like it wasn't soft at all, to the point I questioned if it was cooked through or not. The beef was ok but kinda overcooked I think; it wasn't tender. There was also quite a bit of oil which I wasn't fond of.
After the tacos I was still hungry so I ordered some quesadillas, but...it was a cheese overload. A literal cheese overload. There was actually nothing else but cheese in the quesadilla. I'm pretty sure that's not how it should be. I couldn't even finish it in the end because it was just too much.
I also ordered a margarita and that was solid, nothing bad to say about it besides that the decorative chili powder on the rim of the glass made it taste a bit salty but not a big problem.

The wine list is the most illegible I have ever seen. The menu has been materially shortened -especially the dishes of the day. Portions have shrunk dramatically, which is actually good news because not one single dish was well executed: either dry, or too salty, or too sugary. One could wait up to 1 hour between two dishes. The French sitting next to us who had known the restaurant for a while were also upset. The only part which hasn't changed is the steep bill.

After dinner, the chef asked me for feedback which I gave him exactly as mentioned above. He apologised. One would have expected a significant discount on the bill, which he didn't even offer.

We walked in to a busy restaurant and were hopeful of a lovely meal after a recommendation from a local French man. 
What followed can only be described as shameful. 
The starters were all cold versions of hot food. Their only saving grace was that it was not paid for.
The rest of the meal, they should have paid us to eat. 
Chicken was served raw, bloody raw. And when this was pointed out to them, there was no apology or concern. This chicken uly avoided was the best part of the main meal. Meat was drier than a Moroccan summers day. Couscous was so bland it could have been raw flour. And that was the speciality!
The chicken that came with the couscous looked like leftover dregs from 4 days previous. All the food was merely boiled (if cooked at all) served with no flavour or style. Unless dumping food on a plate is 'style' in which case they get 10/10.
I can only assume the other patrons were stooges. You would have to pay me more money than Apple have in the bank to go back and eat there again.

928167647,"We had three major gripes about an otherwise generally good meal. Located nearly to the peripherique in the 17th, but just a long block walk from the Pont Cardinet stop on the 14 Metro in an uncrowded modern two level establishment, the chef offers a very good carte with many international flavors informing French techniques.

For starters, we had a great salmon gravlax with complex flavors and clever textural elements.  Problem #1 was the other starter, billed as ""Huîtres"" (as in multiple oysters) which, quelle suprise, was ONE oyster.  The preparation was lovely, playing well with the briny taste of the oyster, but it was infuriating to pay 15€ for what was really only one bite.

We both had the pork main dish, being pluma which is an obscure and very tender but flavorful cut from the neck of the pig, served with a nice selection of seasonal (winter) vegetables.  

Problem #2 was when we decided to have a cheese plate to finish our red wine before dessert.  It was billed as a selection of cheeses, but was five pieces of nearly identical firm cow cheese, with a scoop of some unrecognizable soft dairy item crowned with very over-cooked crisps (turned out to be salsify).  The cheeses were presented without any explanation of what they were.  Perhaps we are hopeless rubes, but we have been eating French dinners for decades, and our expectation for a cheese course after a full French dinner is for some variety to stimulate and entertain the palate, not to bore it to death. (We ate less than half before capitulation, and to the restaurant's credit, our server struck the cheese from our bill without our saying anything.)  We were so demoralized, we passed on what seemed to be several promising dessert offerings.
Problem #3 was the small, round/octaganal table we had.  It was terribly  unsteady, on a small base, and promised to dash our meal to the floor repeatedly.  The couple seated next to us had the same type of table and had the good sense to relocate to a nearby normal table to finish their wine and have coffee at the end of their meal.

Two starters and two mains were 89€.  Wine list is good, a number of reasonably priced possibilities.  A very good Buisson Saint-Romain burgundy and two glasses of good Lanson champagne added 131€.  Service was professional.  We might give the place another chance.","Good, but three problems",4,Couples,6024248

I was provided with a signed menu, a personalised photograph, a welcome to Paris cake, a book of the best restaurants in the world, and with a pastry for breakfast the next morning.

As expected, the food was absolutely divine, every single course and wine pairing was heavenly. There were some unexpected surprises in the preparation, too, which enhanced the experience.

The restaurant is situated in the effortlessly glamorous and sophisticated George V Hotel. The hotel looked even more chic than usual with its Christmas decorations making a tasteful but spectacular display - I particularly enjoyed the ice sculpture and Christmas tree forest (perfect for selfies) at the main entrance.

960827827,"Catastrophe”
Introduction: In the heart of Paris, nestled among the cobblestone streets and historic landmarks, lies Le Cinq—a three Michelin-starred restaurant that promises classic French dining. But what happens when a British food critic, armed with wit and a pen, steps through its doors? Brace yourself for a tale of taupe decor, overpriced plates, and culinary calamity.
The Experience: Upon entering Le Cinq, our intrepid reviewer found the dining room adorned in “various shades of taupe, biscuit, and [expletive] you.” Not exactly the ambiance one expects from a gastronomic palace. But that was just the beginning.
The Menu: Our critic’s female dining companion received a menu sans prices—a subtle hint that this was no ordinary bistro. When the revised menu revealed that a single plate of food could cost as much as £120 (70 to 140 Euros), eyebrows were raised. Perhaps they were paying for the taupe decor?
The Culinary Conundrum: Let’s talk about the food. The canapé, described as “like eating a condom that’s been left lying about in a dusty greengrocer’s,” set the tone. Gratinated onions resembled nightmares—mostly black and sticky, akin to a teenager’s party floor. And the scallops? They tasted like iodine, leaving our critic longing for a glass of mouthwash.",Bad restraunt,1,Business,699456

The service was excellent, efficient, kind and nothing was too much trouble. You will feel like royalty. The staff teamed up to make sure both plates hit the table at the same time and with the silver cloches lifted on each dish simultaneously.

We started with a glass of super sparkling champagne and there were a number of great options by the glass. The food was right up there with the best restaurants in the world.  Dessert was not as fabulous as the rest.

Le Pantheon restaurant in Paris holds a special place in my heart as a wonderful neighborhood eatery. During my visits, I had the pleasure of being assisted by the lovely lady, Irene, whose warm presence added an extra touch of hospitality.

The restaurant's charm lies in its unpretentious atmosphere and cozy ambiance. It is the kind of place where you feel immediately comfortable, as if you were dining in your own neighborhood. Le Pantheon offers a welcoming haven to enjoy a delicious meal without unnecessary frills.

The overall pleasant atmosphere of Le Pantheon, coupled with the delectable food, created an enjoyable dining experience. The restaurant quickly became a favorite, prompting me to visit not just a couple of times, but multiple times during my stay in Paris.

If you're looking for a restaurant that embraces simplicity, yet offers mouthwatering cuisine, I highly recommend a visit to Le Pantheon.

Initially I tried to check their menu on their webpage but there isn't one. then I found out they have a short but focused menu - selection is not wide but I think that is because they want to avoid food loss and trying to cook with what is in season where it is applicable. Very ethical.

We naturally had one of each course, and then shared! Egg mayonnaise with miso was a classic with a delicious twist, and the “quartet of radishes, pickled apple, with a mustard sesame vinaigrette” was a taste sensation. The mains were sausage with piment d’espelette, potatoes sautéed with garlic and parsley and mustard sauce, and perfectly cooked pasta with cream of artichoke and Comté cheese. These were both magnificent. The combination of quetsch plum roasted in olive oil, a kind of grape jelly, crumble and whipped cream was made in heaven. And of course the chocolate mousse was as light as air. The Big Boss is characterful, friendly, bilingual and extremely knowledgeable about wine. The staff are wonderful.

988552962,"I was there with my daughter for her birthday tonight. We are only in Paris 2 nights and she wanted Indian for her birthday and I asked our hotel concierge for a recommendation and he suggested this one. I would rate the overall food and service just average. 

I had ordered the king prawn tandoori dish. There was 2 king prawns. While they were decent size prawns and reasonably tasty the dish was very small and not at all filling. This dish was €30 whereas the normal prawn dish was €17. I believe the waiter should have advised me when ordering that this dish contained 2 prawns only. I have had similiar king prawn dishes in Indian restaurants in many other counties and generally speaking it is served with 6 prawns. This one was far inferior to other similiar dishes I have had. 
I would not have written a negative review however if it wasn’t for the fact that when I asked for the bill the waiter added an extra naan bread and an extra glass of wine to the bill. Give I had indicated my dis-satisfaction with the prawn dish I expected they may have taken something off my bill, not added extras that I did not order. The attitude of the waiters and manager who I dealt with when I complained about the error was extremely rude and there was no apology. They basically wanted me to pay and leave asap before other customers could hear our discussion. 
I got the impression that the assumed as a tourist I could not read a French bill and would not spot the extras. 
I rarely leave a negative review but round not recommend this restaurant. I’m sure there are far better Indians in Paris!",Disappointing portion size …tried to overcharge me,2,Family,4451589

948410007,"We were referred here by a friend.  We are gourmands and like good wines.  We are from California, and we looked forward to this experience with expectations of fine, unique food paired, by the restaurant with wines for each dish. The food and wines paired wonderfully.  The staff was super attentive. It would have got 5 stars except for one major faux pas. The sommelier was a bit arrogant when we objected to his pouring of a nice red Pinot with one of the courses. The bottle ran out after filling a half a glass. He got another bottle.  We assumed he would pour from the new bottle into a fresh glass.  He did not.  We objected.  He said it was the same wine. We always have fine wines and even if it is the same vintage, a new bottle should never be poured into a glass half filled from the last bottle. He said it is the same wine, no problem! Yes, problem we stated as it should not be co-mingled for obvious reasons. But wait. We noticed it was not the same vintage or winery or grape! He still poured it and walked away.  we complained to other staff.  No avail. Apparently he was more powerful than other staff as this major faux pas was not rectified. We were appalled. It was wrong and it appeared he was arrogant towards us as if we did not know better.  Really???
We did get an extra pour on another flight later and he did chat with us with a little more respect, however, he never acknowledged nor responded about this rude mistake of co-mingling different red wines  on the one  pour for a wonderful food pairing of a main dish. Unacceptable. Rude.  Wrong.  That being said, all else was excellent, but this did upset our evening and we will not return, nor recommend ordering the dinner with wine pairings.  Order your own bottle(s) and control the pour!",Good with a major faux pas!,4,Couples,7130375

The food itself was good also and at good price.

When we wanted to pay a woman took over. Very rude, claims that your cards declines and instantly points you at an atm. 
At the moment you point out that a visa has no limit and it’s their machine they refuse to speak English and treat you like a fool.

All they want is you to pay cash, leave without “facture” and put your money in the “we don’t pay tax on foreigners box”

August 1, 2024 at 630pm
Our family of 4 (2 teens) had just finished a river boat tour and approached this restaurant for dinner. 
We were asked if we had a reservation, which we did not have. We were told entrance was only available by reservation.

The restaurant was mostly empty. 

We were put off but it is on a boat in front of the Eiffel tower, and it had air conditioning (32C), so we immediately booked a reservation online for 10 minutes from then and went back. We told the attendant that we now had a reservation, he requested to see it, and we were allowed in. 
There was no indication from this man that we could make a reservation when he first turned us away. 
We were served rock hard bread then medium quality food for adequate value (€100 for four small mains and two iced teas). I asked our waiter, who was pleasant, what the deal was with the man at the door. We had watched him turn away about 25 people during the course of our meal. 
The waiter asked the senior staff who explained that IF THE MANAGER DOESN'T LIKE HOW SOMEONE LOOKS they may be told they need a reservation. I am not sure what the requirements are, however, because there was a variety of people eating in the mostly empty boat. It was almost like he didn't want to serve anyone unless he had to. 
Another woman eating with her young daughter stopped me on the way out and thanked me for asking about the treatment, as they had been denied service, but she insisted and was allowed in. 

As I said, this was very bizarre experience.",They didn't want to let anyone in,2,Family,2346326

I would highly recommend this cafe as it’s in a great location within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower also and located right by a metro station. The only way it loses a star is I’d say there is a bit of a rushed and squeezed feel so you won’t have much space to try meet the demand of customers and you do have to expect to have to queue and wait but of course this is just because of a cafe smashing it out of the park with its service and great food and drink.,Best hot chocolate in Paris but prepare to wait,4,Couples,1035619

The restaurant wasn't open but at first look it doesn't appear to be a place to come for fine dining -- it is however a perfect spot for a little snack-and-sun break should you find yourself in the neighborhood. We happened upon it walking back towards city center from Port Henry IV. We had a 'tartine' for two but in fact it was just a little pot of cold spread (pâté, seafood spread, etc.) with slices of poilâne bread and some cornichons. Granted, the duck pâté we had delicious -- and, I'm told by my French husband, very authentic -- but it certainly wasn't enough for lunch and we ended up ordering the shrimp pâté as well (also delicious -- on the poilâne, quite fragrant, with fresh slices of lemon). Not fancy at all, but also a nice and welcome break from overpriced brasseries and fast food options that otherwise abound.

We stated the facts only and will leave for all readers to judge for themselves.
Context:
We reserved a table for 8 persons to celebrate a birthday lunch. This was our first time to this restaurant as this was a recommendation from people who have dined previously.
The table given to us was at the back in a room with closed windows and no natural light. Due to the lack of air circulation and light, we asked to be relocated towards the front.
Opening the windows will allow the smell of the restaurant garbage bins to come in.
At the front, there was one table with 6 customers.
The first response from the lady was that we should have reserved and asked for the front. She did not want to accommodate our request regardless of our insistence.
She did not make any efforts and any flexibility to find a solution. Not knowing the restaurant was not acceptable and just too bad. Her attitude was quite awful!
We called the owner and complained about the unfriendly service and not commercially friendly.
After long explanation and pleading, the owner agreed for us to sit in front.
Given the space and small tables, there were 2 round tables left that we could put together for 8 persons.
She and another colleague did not move from their positions at all. They stood and watched us putting the two tables together. We had to ask for additional sets of napkins, spoons, chopsticks... 
From that moment on, the meals were just to symbolize the birthday and gathering of the family. 
While we were there and for the rest of the afternoon, there was only 2 additional tables of 4 persons

The restaurant confirmed the table the previous day.  When we got there on Friday, the wait staff said they had no table for us and didn’t say anything about the karaoke. It took them 45 minutes to take our drink order. 
The waiter brought the bottle of white wine to the table and opened it, put it on the table and left to help other customers; I touched the bottle, which was warmer than room temp and we pointed this out when he finally returned. He calmly said that it was the only one they had and we should be happy with that… um, no. We ordered a bottle of whatever white they had that was cold.
We managed to order about 15 minutes after that, and the appetisers took another 15 minutes to arrive … again, at room temp and I know they weren’t meant to be so.

The food was delicious. We had two starters - houmous de betterave Maison (‘House beetroot hummus’) (with soda bread) and mozza balls Maison (‘House mozzarella balls’). The beetroot hummus was a culinary experience (to be tried at home with perhaps harissa and nigella). The main was the Double Smash Cheeseburger (made with grass-fed Angus beef). It was truly succulent. (The first top-notch burger since Zürich in February 2020.) The cheesy fries (frites maison au cheddar fondu) went down well. The house frites were fine by me.

Molly’s also does a strong selection of Irish whiskeys and beers. Pints come in many forms including Köstritzer (alas not it’s trademark Schwarzbier). Wine list needs improving, I’d suggest, but that is not its forte.

Nothing short of a Franco-Irish culinary sensation. Highly recommended.",A Franco-Irish taste sensation,5,Family,21204463

An email was sent last minute/same day & they offered several options but too late for us to change dinner plans for a party of 6, being a weekend. The foie gras pastry was delicious but cold for several of us. Actually, none of the food was hot, which I don’t understand since there were only 16 people on the whole boat! The sea bass was fishy tasting for the 2 of us that ordered it. The other 4 had rib eye steak & all complained it was very hard to cut & it was chewy, although cooked perfect for medium. The wines were young (chefs choice) which we found disappointing, being in France! All in all, a lovely boat but between not sailing & the food cold & not good quality, we would not recommend it. I read many reviews & watched YouTube videos highly recommending them but this was not OUR experience. The Seine water level has been high, even their Batobus was not running, so I don’t think this was a rarity for them.

We had the table at the very front of the boat, and enjoyed the ""Menu Royal"" which includes wine and sparkling water. Nice to pay when booking, and not have to worry about a bill at the end of the evening. 

From the welcome glass of champagne and cheese puffs to the dessert, the entire meal was delicious, well paced and we enjoyed excellent, attentive service.

No.  This is the point at which many would have sent the dish back to the kitchen; however and as everything was wrong, I was keen to avoid further disappointments.

She knew perfectly well that I didn't understand her, but she didn't care. She just rushed me and pointed to one of the shelves, which at that moment was empty, with no bread, so it was of no use. Later, when I went to pay, the lady at the cash desk did the same. She was amused by the situation and did not attend to me; she was busy serving two of her customers at the same time, using two bank dataphones so that we could pay. She also knew that I didn't speak French and I asked her several times which bank machine I should use, but she ignored me and laughed because I didn't understand.

He recommended that we choose about five dishes all of which could be shared. As the tables were small (and tightly packed) we wondered where it would all go but it generally rolled out with small time gaps and somehow managed to fit! We had a total of five main dishes, a dessert, and two glasses of wine for a total bill of 82euros which we considered to be excellent value.","Friendly, professional service. Tasty food.

- They need more spice in their cooking or should have hot sauce in the restaurant for diners.
- They could do special weeks. For example, in the week of Diwali, Indian-style food and desserts. For Hanukkah, traditional Jewish dishes/fried stuff, and so on.
- The desserts are good
- The loyalty program is good (10 stamps for a glass bowl, 5 for a dessert).","Good food if you eat meat, could be better for vegans",4,NONE,15347677

986619008,"Review of Riviera Fuga Restaurant by the Seine, Paris
“La Pire recommendation de la publication Marie Claire, Cuisine te Vins”

The experience at this Seine-side establishment was deeply disappointing. While the restaurant boasts an enviable location along the river and attractive interior decoration, these proved to be the only highlights of our visit.

The booking process was unnecessarily complicated, with multiple confirmation emails flooding our inbox. We received separate messages about a 20-minute hold policy for reservations and a two-hour table limit.

We arrived 45 minutes early and were seated promptly. Despite a prominent ""OPEN"" sign illuminating the entrance, we discovered the kitchen wasn't actually serving the dinner menu. We adapted by ordering two tapas while waiting for the full kitchen service to begin.

What followed was a series of service failures:
- Our tapas took an hour to arrive, requiring five separate follow-ups with staff
- The main courses never materialized
- After two hours of waiting, we had to request our check and leave without having a proper meal

The service was completely disorganized and dysfunctional. While the food we did manage to try was adequate, it couldn't compensate for the chaotic service and mismanagement of the evening.

This establishment, despite its prime location and pleasant ambiance, delivered one of the most disappointing dining experiences in Paris.",Only visit If You Want to Experience Chaos and Poor Service!,1,Couples,25579641
986495970,We went there on our first day in Paris and it was the perfect opening for Paris gastronomic tour. The ambience of the place and the taste of food was above and beyond.

983316028,"The location is nice, on the river, near many tourist spots and was great for us because we did a river cruise just before. However, personally I didn't love the fact that it's on a barge because you do feel movement as the cruise ships come past and it made me feel a little bit travel sick! My issue, not theirs. 
We had the tapas to start and shared several items which were all delicious. However, the mains then took quite a long time to arrive. I ordered the ravioli and had 6 pieces, it came cold and wasn't really worth the wait, which was a shame because the food up to that point had been good.","Tapas good, ravioli meh",3,Business,25579641

5.0 star rating4/29/2023
What a wonderful surprise. Mauvaises Graines is located in the not-very-frequented-by-tourists Paris 13eme. My wife noticed the restaurant; we perused the menu on-line, and decided to give it a try.  Our experience was excellent. The staff greeted us warmly and made us comfortable immediately. Pours (drinks) are, well, generous. I had a Lillet and tonic.) While an informal restaurant, service is gracious and the food delicious. We started with a beet salad and a salmon tartar (in creme fraiche); our mains were a risotto with langoustines and stir-fried (and extremely tender) squid with courgettes in a coconut-based sauce. Artisan-made ice cream completed our dinner. We were touched when our waiter offered my wife a small bowl of water to cleanse her fingers following her encounter with lagoustines.)

Mauvaises Graines means ""bad seeds"" and the restaurant's motto is ""good place for bad guys,""

637608570,"I'm 8-months pregnant, and I work about 15-minutes on foot from this restaurant. I ate dinner here once and liked the food and ambiance, but today I had an upsetting experience during my lunch hour. 

I ordered the salmon bowl to go, not realizing that the salmon in this bowl is served almost raw, which is not recommended for pregnant women, due to the increased risks during pregnancy around listeria and toxoplasmosis. I opened the box and saw the nearly raw salmon when I returned to my office and promptly set back off to the restaurant to return it. 

When I explained to the waitress that I can't eat salmon unless it's well cooked, she was brusque and impatient. She told me that other pregnant women eat salmon confit, which I find to be a completely weird and inappropriate response. When I told her that, regardless, I can't eat the salmon like that, she didn't say another word but simply took the box back to the kitchen, and then began serving other customers. I waited about 5 minutes to think about what to do and decided that I would probably feel best just leaving. I waited until she wasn't serving anyone and then told her that she could keep the salmon and my money (16,50€), because I just wanted to leave. Again, she didn't say a word to me but simply gave me an impatient look and went back to the kitchen. I waited for her to get back as she was obviously talking to the cook / owner about my salmon. When she returned, she had my box in hand and handed it to me without a word of explanation. I asked her if it was now well cooked, and she responded emphatically that ""yes it was very well cooked now."" 

I left, upset about being treated rudely but assuming that I could now safely eat the salmon. When I got back to the office, however, I discovered that the salmon is still nearly raw in the middle. I don't feel like going back out a third time to get something to eat and honestly don't have much appetite anyway from feeling a little sick at spending my time and money being treated so poorly.

With few options for breakfast, I decided to finally give La Boheme a chance, but it’s doubtful that I’ll be back. Service was fine, but I was disappointed that my request for an egg white omelet could not be accommodated. I decided to go with the fried egg/avocado/bacon/cheese sandwich, and made it very clear to the waiter that I did not want bacon (I cannot eat it, and really dislike it). He acknowledged this very simple request, but when my sandwich came out, the bacon was up front and center. I debated bringing it to the waiter’s attention, but this typically doesn’t go over well in Europe. Unfortunately, even after removing it from the sandwich, the egg still tasted very much like bacon. The lettuce in the salad was also predominately rotten, and the waiter didn’t bother checking on me once.

The shop stitched in one of those small streets in Trocadero totally-touristy area. 

There is something so inviting about seeing someone reading so peacefully inside a small shop with warmly-lit interior, intimately bricked. Beautiful. So I stopped walking and walked in to the shop. That someone whom I saw reading that day turned out to be the Shop Owner. Order was spoken, started with “S’il vous plait” of course, the soonest I scanned the Menu. 

While waiting for my Tuna Bagel, I thought about this TripAdvisor Reviewer who wrote an angry piece about this place because this person was told to “look at the Menu with your eyes” when the expectation was probably to be indulged immortally with What’s On the Menu. Well, this is Paris. Princes and Princess should eat elsewhere.

877327319,"Good evening, unfortunately I didn't think that in Paris I could have such an experience in a respectable restaurant, the arrogance and racism shown by that older waiter left something to be desired, since I work as a waiter and I know how  it is , but unfortunately such an attitude and such behaviour is not allowed.

I don't usually leave negative reviews but unfortunately in connection with this experience I couldn't help myself, considering that the beef he served smelled and tasted rotten and that the colour before it was cooked didn't look like it should for a piece of beef.
Considering that if a food is not good and tastes bad and has a sour smell, I don't think it's fair to add it to the bill and on top of that to have a very low attitude and be very revolted because I said I don't pay for steaks.

The hospitality and quality with which restaurants should treat travelers should be at a certain level considering that Paris is a renowned city, this restaurant does not even deserve 1 star.","The worst experience, don't waste your time, money and health",1,Family,19067246

However, Conor not only remembered us from having popped our heads around the door earlier in the day, but he also went out of his way to find us a table. We were able to order food and drinks quickly and were even moved when space became available at the bar so that we could see the TV and watch the tennis which had been put on especially for us. It was not only Conor who was so helpful and attentive. We found the rest of the staff cheerful, enthusiastic and friendly. The food was tasty and plentiful and the beer was superb.

The staff’s attitude was rude and dismissive. Our beers, priced at €20 each, were slammed on the table, all poured to inconsistent levels. Despite this, we gave the meal a chance the onion soup was decent, but the main course was a disaster.

We each ordered the fillet of beef (€44). One plate had two of the smallest marble-sized potatoes you ever seen, another had six, so we asked if the first could have a few more potatoes. The staff laughed and scoffed before reluctantly bringing a few extras. My steak, requested rare to blue, arrived medium to well-done. When I pointed this out, the waiter  agreed but returned it with an attitude and said , “My boss says it’s fine.” When I insisted on a replacement, I was told to pick something else, as “the boss says no.”

When we asked for the service charge to be removed due to the appalling service, we were flatly refused. They insisted it was “our culture” presumably because we are British. I’ve not experienced this sort of racism before.

I recently visited Trocadero and, unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. Upon arrival, we inquired whether we could smoke while dining, and one of the waitresses gave us the green light. However, shortly after ordering, another waiter abruptly informed us that smoking was not allowed. Confused, we explained that we had already received permission from his colleague, but this led to further inconsistency as other staff members continued to contradict each other on the smoking policy.
To make matters worse, while speaking with my friend at a normal volume, a staff member approached us and requested that we speak more quietly due to other patrons nearby. I found this request inappropriate, especially as we were not being excessively loud.
Additionally, I noticed the waitstaff engaging in conversation amongst themselves very close to our table, laughing and behaving as if we weren't there. This felt disrespectful and added to the overall discomfort of our experience.
As someone with over a decade of hospitality experience, I was taken aback by the lack of cohesive communication among the staff and their overall attitude. Clear guidelines and respectful service are fundamental in the hospitality industry, and unfortunately, Trocadero fell short in both areas.

988094623,"I read some negative reviews about Cubana Cafe and I can tell you after going that my experience was completely different. I went there to smoke a cigar on a Monday night and had a great time. When you come through the front door, the bar is the first thing you see. The seating for the restaurant is to the left, toward the end of the bar. As you enter that area you’ll notice an upright humidor filled with Cubans, Davidoff and other brands. It’s a great selection. The prices are clearly posted. There is also some unique art on the walls. The smoking room is to the back, to the left of the dining area. I got a Mojito and let me warn you because the cocktail menu must have at least ten mojitos you can order. I thought a mojito was a mojito, but no. I got the 7 year old Cuban rum mojito, $11 (I use the $ sign because the Euro and USD are just about equal as I write this). The prices are clearly written on the menu. The mojito was really good and an had adequate amount of booze. I went directly to the smoking lounge and noticed that there were slightly more than a dozen people smoking, even a table with two women. The room has leather chairs and stainless steel vertical cigar ashtrays that rise about two feet off the ground with four different cigar holders for smokers to rest their sticks. They also have a couple of wooden tables with stools. There is cedar to light your stogey in a glass vase on top of a small bar in the room. While there is a tiny bar in the room, know that you need to go out to the main bar to order another drink; however, there is also an employee in the room from time to time who will go to the bar and bring you a drink. Not sure how that works, it may be that the customers he was bringing drinks to were regulars, but it’s no big deal. I went out and got another mojito in the middle of my smoke and came back. Don’t speak French? No problem, the staff speaks English and Spanish. I didn’t have dinner, but I love Cuban food so I’ll be back for dinner and another stogey. They have WiFi.

After a brief back and forth of telling the guy that i I paid the same amount of money to be there and he has no right to talk to me like that I was ejected from the club/bar instead of him. The main bouncer was extremely aggressive and not even willing to listen to me for a minute to hear out my side of the story. It must have been 5 minutes after I was trying to explain to the bouncers exactly what had transpired that they tossed the same drunk guy out on his ass in front of the bar. I then proceeded to explain that it was him and his group that started the interaction with me but they still didn’t give a damn. If you are Latino do not go this place because they will discriminate against you if you are not from France, first time I felt racism in this city. Even though the bouncer was black it was clear he did not like latinos from the first interaction I had with him. 0/10 rating for the main bouncer but the other 2 bouncers were a little more susceptible to the situation since they heard the facts.

I wanted to like it so so bad because it was super pricey and it was beautiful but honestly it was hard to even finish our food. It truly tasted like they threw a very thin slice of meat on a plate and slopped some gravy on top and served it to my wife, It looked like a microwaved TV dinner, no flavor, no salt, and a super weird after taste. As for my dish, i ordered a pulled pork dish with potatoes on top and it was ice cold, no salt or flavor only lemon flavor. who wants to eat cold potatoes?? we heard getting hot chocolate in Paris was a must so we tried it and..... very bland. There was a couple with their two kids sitting next to us and we heard them all complaining about the food tasting nasty and they had different dishes than what we had. The service was fine, as to be expected in Europe. We got used to the ""American treatment"" by the end of our trip that i didn't even care anymore. lol this review is solely for the food though. Seriously though it was the worst food we had in a 4 week vacation. 70$ for two meals and two hot cups of chocolate and a water. What added insult to injury is that when we walked out and made a quick right there was a hole in the wall hot dog restaurant that had the best looking hot dogs I have ever seen and there was a line full of people and the hot dogs were only 3 Euros. lmao. Please take my advise and if you HAVE to come here just get a drink and enjoy the vibe and when you get hungry step out of the restaurant and make a right and turn into the hot dog place. lol DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS SLOP.",slop,1,Couples,24851162

The place looks more like a takeaway restaurant from the outside, but when we walked in, we realised that it is actually a very cozy little restaurant (I guess they do takeaways too) with pleasant lighting and good music. There were only couple of tables downstairs and I assume more upstairs, but we did not get to go there as they were opening it later in the evening.

The service was good and our waiter spoke good enough English. I was also very pleased with the food I ordered, and the total price for my meal including the can of ice tea was 14€. I did not leave the place hungry! 

I take this place is a chain restaurant and they normally put me off a little bit - don't ask why, but I would say, I am very positively surprised about how good my experience was, eventhough I'm not sure if this was the most authentic Indonesian street food...

So if you are after some basic/good + filling food, and don't want to pay a huge amount of money for it, try Djawa.",Reasonably priced great food with good portion sizes,4,Friends getaway,13005530

Like when you first go in and you dont really get how the place is working, like do we have to order first or shall we sit etc ... nobody is even asking if they can help you with anything eventhought you look lost. That was the first minus for me. Then we went to the till, while i was ordering i asked about the drink, if it's part of a menu or something but the guy was not being cooperative, not letting me know about the price and all. Another small minus, you're not getting your average ticket up if you're explaining how it works (and not really smiling as well). And after checking me out he didnt even say to go and have sit while there is actually someone coming to the table to give you the food, nope, i was standing there awkwardly without any instructions. Thanks dude. Huge minus, i dont care if i have to pick up my food or go and sit but please let me know what should i do. 
Oh! And it was not even the peak time, like 5 minutes after the opening so no reason to be stressed out or worn out because you've been crazy busy.

Three varieties of generic charcuterie in one closed container with smoked salmon. Two kinds of pastries.

- Pasta with blue cheese - the pasta was basically puree. It was overcooked, most probably cooked prior and put in the microwave as we ordered.
- Onion soup: the soup had a bitter taste. How is it possible to underperform an onion soup? You should really hate people in general.
- Water - tasted rancid. I thought that it's because of the Parisian pipes, but went to a bar next door right after to forget about this nightmare and the water tasted just fine.

It might be hard for a beginner to chose the easiest meals to start with ; I would recommend you the eggplants (鱼香茄子), the sichuan chicken (宫爆鸡丁) and the Beef with onions. Having said that, the spicy 'Mala' dishes are wonderful, if you're willing to take more risks

For me the dining experience is about the WHOLE experience. From the time you make the reservation to the time you leave the restaurant.

Started at 19:30H 
* In summary, we waited 40 minutes to get our drink orders, I tried to make contact with the staff that we hadn’t been asked even for just water, when I finally did they sent us some.  

* Our table neighbors arrived at 20H got their wines ordered and received them before us., we ordered about the same time. 

 *Decided to order our meal, cause we didn’t know if he’d ever come back. 

*Got our entrées still no wine nor beverages we ordered. 

*reminded them about the wines, finally a bottle I asked for came when we were 3/4 done with our entrée.

*NOTE: The first batch of bread we got was bordering on stale. They must've ordered it that morning and let it sit out, or figured we were not french and they figured we wouldn't mind being served stale bread, which has happened before. However, the 2nd batch was much better. 

*finished entrée, main came, 2 of our friends asked about their glass of wine and bottle of sparkling water they had yet to receive and ordered it upfront when I ordered our bottle. Finally it came and keep in mind we were almost done with our mains. NOTE: entrée and mains were OK, but my steak was way overcooked, almost like leather, and I asked of it to be a point (medium rare). 

*Ordered dessert, big Mistake, came out 1/2 later, after the staff took a cigarette break. My father was a pastry chef so when I said it was bad, it was horrendous. The filling was so laden with gelatin, cutting into it was like cutting soft rubber. Ordered the rhubarb cheesecake. Now onto the flavors, what flavor, there was none. How do you describe white rubber a flavor? There may have been 2-3 drops of rhubarb. In fairness the only thing that tasted good on this dish was the strawberries and the little pavlova cookies.  But what kinda effort takes to make that.

I’ve lived in Paris for 14-years, and this is one of my 5 top worst dining experiences of all time, and I'm world traveled.   Some of you are probably wondering why we just didn't get up and leave within the 1st 40 minutes, in hindsight we should've. But we were having such a good time catching up with friends and we were not in a rush and it was a gorgeous warm night.

432735371,"A very unlikely location for a personally and individually cooked gourmet meal, but this was so worth it!  Housed in what used to be an old ice house, refrigerated rooms, this huge building, with its own water tower, became occupied by artists after being abandoned.  The city of Paris bought it so that the squatter-artists could continue to live there legally, while paying only nominal rent.  

La Maison's door is around the side of this all-graffiti covered building, and you wouldn't venture in unless you knew where you were going. It is run and cooked by a petite Japanese woman, Mme. Mariko.   She is adorable, and bows to greet you.  You have very little choice with the menu, it is all cooked at the time by her, and cost 25 Euros the day we went.  It was really astonishing.  

She first prepared (beautifully) the appetizer of about 5 individual treats, including sardines, cucumber and seaweed salad, and several others.  Each was just perfect, and absolutely delicious!  The main course was a huge plate of all things tempura, from salmon to vegetables, to rice--all amazingly good.  

It is a very humble room, and you almost feel as though you were in someone's home kitchen. Certainly no mass production!.  I literally never finish everything on my plate, especially this many foods and this much to eat...but it was impossible not to eat it all.  So many different tastes, and all tantalizing.

For dessert, we were given the choice of lemon  or chocolate pie. I chose the lemon, and it was the best I've ever tasted--and my husband felt the same about his chocolate pie. 

We were the last people there, and Mme. Mariko was gracious enough to answer questions about her enterprise.  She allowed as it was difficult for her to cook ""commercially"" for a lot of other people, and only found satisfaction is cooking for people who really appreciated it. She also told us that she is an artist, as well, and explained how she did her lovely wall hangings adorning the kitschy place. 

The restroom was like someone's guest bath...just more eclectic...all done in wild colors with a red enamel toilet seat.  Very clean and lovely.

Even though not the least bit French, this is one of the best meals we have had in Paris!  We would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a home-cooked Japanese meal and an incredible experience.

974446766,So I now realise that when a French waiter asks where you are from you should tell them that it’s none of their business. Why? As soon as you tell them you’re from Australia they immediately decide that they need to prove to themselves that they are superior and Australians will eat whatever they serve you. Why? Because Melbourne Australia is recognised as the food capital of the world and Australian wines now routinely beat French wines at international competitions. Proof? Look at the picture of what I was served as steak. Tasteless tough meat that hadn’t even been properly rested. A disgrace to their industry!!,Disgraceful!,1,Couples,2192483

I had Calamares as a starter and Penne siziliana as main dish, Tira misu as a desert, altogether about 48 Euros. Although my first visual impression was 'nothing special', the flavour of each dish hit me by surprise. Very complex flavour, not over salted or overspilled, but rather mild and diverse. My colleagues had other dishes, e.g. the fish, melenzana (aubergines), risotto, linguine a la vongole, and each one of them was stunned by the quality cooking. The red wine served with it (ours was per glass) was a 2017 French grape, also stunning. All ingredients were bought freshly from the market same day.

953567277,"Went here for dinner with a few of my colleagues some days ago. The interior isn't very big so if you are with a big group and you plan on going at dinner time, especially during the chillier months, I would recommend calling in advance.

Other than that, the place is very welcoming, and so was the staff, which also spoke good English (luckily because most of us barely spoke any French, haha).

The dishes are original recipes that often offer a mix of Italian and French cuisine. I ordered:

- as appetizer, a green bean salad with hazelnuts and sliced mushrooms. Salads aren't usually the kind of dish that is going to blow your mind, but this one was good. 
- chicken supreme with risotto. Can't remember the rest of the ingredients but this dish was VERY very good. Both the chicken and the risotto were very flavorful, and the risotto was definitely one of the best I've had. In Italy we usually have rice/pasta and meat as separate courses (""primo"" and ""secondo"") but I have to say the two mixed very well here. Absolutely loved this dish.
- raspberry and lime tiramisu. Also enjoyed this one a lot! Different taste from ""classic"" tiramisu obviously, but they worked very well together, had the correct texture, were well presented, anything you could want from a tiramisu really. Was a bit amused when the waiter told me ""it's not like the ones they make in Italy"" - man, I've eaten some sloppy tiramisu in Italy, don't worry about yours, you're doing more than okay :D

A creamy risotto and a good not great roasted Fennel completed the meal.  Portions too big to allow a great dessert line up.

The service was absolutely shocking. As a former waitress I know what it is like to work in hospitality…if I had have spoken to my customers the way we were spoken to here, I would  have lost my job on the spot. 

The staff have absolutely no time for those who do not speak French, and try to make non French speakers out as stupid. If you are a tourist, I would avoid at all costs. 

Also reading through the bad reviews here, I can see the team have replied to all the complaints with the exact same pre-written response….which shows just how little they care about customers who have had a bad experience.

After this wait we were then blindsided by being told to wait an additional 20 minutes before receiving our table which we had booked 2 weeks in advance. Eventually we were seated , ordered and ate which was the only pleasant part of our experience mostly due to our lovely server Vincent. One of us ordered carbonara which resembled more of a slightly out of date Mac and cheese. Another ordered a basic pizza asking for rocket leaves on top, yet when the pizza came it was a measly sprinkle of less than 10 leaves, which was disappointing to say the least. After this, we received our bill and were shocked to see a 5 € additional charge for these few leaves which is an outrageous price to charge. We bought 3 pizzas and 1 pasta dish. This came to a jaw dropping bill of €100. Drinks were an astonishing €20-10 each including soft drinks much higher than any price I’ve ever encountered in Paris over many years. FURTHERMORE, we had mentioned it was one of our guest’s birthday to the staff and not one thing was done in celebration of this, whilst other tables were sung happy birthday with sparklers and cakes.

At a time when it's difficult to make the right choices when it comes to catering, especially when traveling, ""Chez Gustave"" is the kind of café that foreign travellers think of when they think of France, and Paris in particular. Located not far from the Effeil Tower, the owners offer Brasserie-style cuisine at reasonable prices. Moreover, they offer a breakfast at a decent price and, above all, the coffee is good (from experience !).

Don't be fooled by some of the other establishments on Avenue de Suffren, which are tourist traps. English and Spanish ( notably Mexican Spanish) are spoken in this café, so you won't have any trouble making yourself understood.

The food was very timely in arrival, well presented and very tasty. One teeny tiny comment is that the meatballs could have been seasoned better, however, the buckwheat was tender and the carrot and onion served with the meatballs was marvellous. The borscht was stunning and filling, and the deserts just excellent.

One weekday after a large breakfast at the hotel and then errands, we stopped in for a light bite for me and just a cold drink for my husband at lunchtime. Then we committed the unforgivable.  We sat in a window seat.  The waiter angrily informed us this was just for people having lunch.  My husband added on a plate of frites and the waiter grudgingly passed on our order.  For the rest of our visit, his nose remained in the air and he did his best to ignore us as though we had attempted to steal items from the table.

In fairness, we ran into this kind of rudeness during the lunch hour at another nearby place with plenty of available window seats. Redirection  would be fine if done with just a touch of courtesy and grace, but rudeness by both waiters and managers is a common problem in Paris and can strike at any time.

We just didn't know it could happen here, especially with the American diner theme creating such a friendly setting.  We had come to this place before over the years and hadn't had a problem, although during our one previous visit here during this stay in Paris the late-night service was less than hospitable.  But this time we apparently did more than just take up space and committed the unforgivable.

This is the kind of thing that can really spoil your day while traveling.  If you stop here, just be aware that a simple misstep can get a very ugly reaction.  This is Paris, and the nasty service problem can rear up anytime, anywhere.  I do recommend the oeves mayonnaise here.

Since the last review they had was from 2020, the menu was completely different when we arrived. Sadly the day we arrived they weren’t serving any pizzas, just regular entreés. Menus are in French only so we had to guess what we were ordering - tried the Secret Iberico and a beef tagliatelle (which I thought would contain pasta but didn’t! Came with fries instead, odd…).

243812069,"Its always refreshing to come across simple down to earth restaurants that surprise with a fantastic atmosphere and great food. Ok perhaps I'm a little nostalgic as this little cafe/bar was previously a place where I spent many great years hanging out, dabbling in the tiny kitchen, cleaning up and just watching my wife's family and friends congregate.  It was you see in the past, the little cafe bar owned by my mother in law who has now leased out the premises to a great group who have created L'Orillon Bar.  Going back brought many memories and absolutely no expectations of what was to come.  Sure, the neighborhood has changed over the last 20 years and yes, whilst the cafe is more or less the same, it is also refreshingly different with a very stylish and earthy vibe.  
We decided to try out the lunch menu-extremely good value at 15 euros for a starter, mains and dessert.  By the grace of Chef Thomas, we were given a few starters to try such as the Betterave Anchois (anchovies with beetroot), their Soupe de Jambon Sec and a fantastic homemade Foie Gras.  We also tried the Avocat Citronette - a simple halved avocado with lemon olive oil and a sprinkling of finely grated kaffir lime leaves.  All starters were superb.  10 out of 10 so far....
There were two choices for the mains - Blanquette de Veau (stewed veal with cream sauce) and Brandade de Cabillaud, citron de kalamata et estragon (slightly reminiscent of the Portuguese salted Cod with mashed potatoes).   Whilst served very simply on mismatched plates, the dishes proved that when you really have great down to earth food, you do not have to dress it up to show its true worth.  Both dishes were of significant portions and had our tastebuds truly happy...10 out of 10 again.
Dessert was also spectacular- we decided to skip the Panacotta and turn to their Compote de Pomme, Chantilly Au speculoos et crunchy de Financier.  Again Chef Thomas showing us how a simple apple compote can be enhanced to gastronomic delights.
So the verdict? 10 out of 10 again.....

The Aperol Spritz seemed to be made with soda and a splash of Aperol, no prosecco, even though the menu stated that prosecco was an ingredient (as is usual).

(This is consistent with our other fine dining experiences) We arrived a few minutes early and were seated immediately. The lobby and restaurant were very pretty and nicely decorated for the holiday. We were given water. We had to ask for a wine menu after we had been sitting for an hour or so. The dinner was a set menu with 6 or 7 courses.

We informed the waiter that our adult children had made other plans and asked if we could speed up the pace. They did try to accommodate this request and we then received the first 3 or 4 courses. The food was generally  not to our taste. Each dish had a very strong sauce that was poured over by the waiter. In many cases the sauce overwhelmed the dish. However, this is a taste preference. Our true complaint was the service. At 11:45, 3.5 hours into the meal, we received the main course. We were not given water during our meal despite asking multiple times. At 12:30 AM, after missing the fireworks, and 4 hours into the meal, we asked for the check and left without receiving dessert or the final little pasteries we saw other people receive.

All clients had to queue , reservation or not , for around 10 minutes , on a very warm parisian evening in the heart of August

There was a first control of the réservation before being allowed to take the stairs .But we first had to patiently wait for the staff to answer a message on social media

And after two minutes , another  pretentious guy made as queue on the stairs under the sun because reservations need to be re-controlled
allowing  small groups of people to progressively enter 

God knows why as there were empty tables 

At least the '' cool rooftop manager'' to be enjoyed the time chating with the clients in front , who  he knew while making as wait 

Because one has to sweat if one wants to enter this unique rooftop parisian bar, this temple of entertainment 

As an athenian/parisian , I suggest to the Toit team that instead of copying the watermelon -feta salad from greek cuisine , to visit some of the numerous beatiful rooftops in Athens center, 
and copy the relaxed ,non pretentious attitude of the staff

bring the glasses, forks and knives

Finally, Get your favorite food (have to admit, brunch is diverse and good)
The Worst of all, get ejected at 2pm from the above mentioned possibly rainy rooftop and be required to bring all the plates and other ustensiles back down to the main floor. With no help nor waiters.

- Generous prices for some really good food

Points of Improvement 😶
- The xiaolongbao really had not enough broth and the broth that was inside was very salty 🥲

Suggestions 💌

934618744,"After reviewing various guides, we decided to make Quedubon our last stop for dinner during our anniversary weekend celebration in Paris and we're we ever glad we did!  It's a little out of the way if you are in the typical neighborhoods in Paris (3rd, 8th, 9th, 10th) but so worth the trip (about 20 min from our hotel).

The service was warm and efficient (thank you Toni from Detroit!), the wine selection extensive and delightful (we had one of the house wines and it was so good I asked to buy a bottle to take with me!), and the best part was the food. 

For starters, we had a very delicious and traditional pate en croute with pistachios accompanied by the bread, sourced from one of the best restaurant bakers in Paris. We also had a spectacular scallop dish lightly ""cooked"" in acid with a delicious flavored butter (paprika maybe). It was so good, we ordered a second! Great start to the meal...

For mains, my wife ordered the venison which was braised in a wine sauce reminiscent of beef bourguignon. It was accompanied by buttery, velvety mashed potatoes. For my money, a match made in heaven. 

Not to be outdone, I went for one of the house specialties: veal brains. I'm a fairly adventurous eater but had never tried brain before. This version was lightly poached and served in a gorgeous, vibrant citrusy beurre blanc. The texture took some getting used to (that's the case with all brain I came to understand) but it was so expertly prepared and delicious, that I have been made a believer in veal brain! Maybe not to try at every restaurant, but certainly on my next trip to Quedubon.

We finished the meal with an acceptable take on  rice pudding (the low point of the evening) but a delightful cheese plate that reminded me why France should be on every food lover's map. The quality, range and flavors were outstanding.

Gorgeous sour dough was continually replenished, a bit of a problem for me because I simply can't resist good bread. The wine choice is very extensive at all price levels.

Though I love the museum cafe, it was still 45 minutes before it opened. As I approached the Miromesnil metro stop, I spied Cojean Miromesnil, and liked the look of this modern eatery so decided to go in.

A display case against one wall and another at the order/pay counter featured a variety of simple, fresh products with good nutritional qualities to take away or eat in. These included soups, salads, fruit, baguettes, yogurt and a variety of drinks. Tempting desserts also appeared. I opted for a Pita Poulet Greeky (4.10 E, about $4.90 U.S.), which consisted of peas, carrots, potato and big pieces of chicken mixed together in pita bread. This proved to be filling and delicious.

Seating includes tables and stools on the ground floor and an upper level as well as tables and chairs outside. I oped to sit downstairs and noted the fairly large room start to fill quickly with customers, who appeared to be locals on lunch breaks. An employee mopped the floor in one area, maintaining the interior's pristine look. Another employee cleared tables, where customers had left items behind.

705496100,"This dining was suppose to be a nice gesture to everyone at the table to end that last day of summer break in style and start anew the following day.  But we regret that we should've went elsewhere.

For a customer who is familiar with Sichuan food, the chef is too sloppy for his execution. As the restaurant claims fait maison, we understand that it takes time (we waited for more than an hour before our food arrived and the place was only starting and not even full) and some of them are pre-made and simply warmed up; however, it is unforgivable that some vegetable is half raw and some not.  The duck was clearly pre-maid, {the texture did not really resemble made well nor appetizing) and warmed up with a blob of aluminum foil next to it, which contained overly salted (non edible) sliced potatoes with not really sichuan flavored cumin spice that was still wet and cold....  
The starter was just really ok for it's price and one of the dish could've use a professional made Sichuan sauce.  It resembled tamari straight from the bottle, but for an accompaniment to dried beef we expected more from a professional kitchen.
The rest of the dish I tried several years ago looked nicer in presentation but again value price does not fullfill the expectations of a customer who really have family and friends from Sichuan and are good chefs.....

As for the ambience...we gave this place a second chance because I want to support our neighborhood restaurant and expected nice dining experience.  The restaurant is roughly divide into two rooms.  One at the back and one in front.  When we walked in there was a big pousette and a mother with small boy babysitting in the front room.  It was clear to us that this two was not a restaurant guest but someone related to the owner.  Therefore, I thought that we simply arrived too early and that it was not really open to customers yet.  It really gave an impression that they were still setting up due to the way this mother was occupying the restaurant seats with her diaper bags and constantly pacing back and forth sitting up from the bench seat in front of the entrance and moving around the pousette.  I would often be charmed by children but this constant walking around sticking her head in the kitchen speaking loudly to the waitresses and moving around her belongings from one place to another bothered me, as I chose this place for the ambience, it was just not acceptable that we had to wait for over an hour to watch this mother babysitting.  I would be not offended had this place been a Chinese take out place, but for what we came for and what we were prepared to pay for it really made me sad.  Since we were not seated at the nicer dining area my view was solely the continuous moving about of this mother yelling to the kitchen, to the waitress and to her phone for the whole 40 min until she pushed her pousette out of the restaurant and left.  I felt exhausted and regretted that I should've stayed home and cooked everyone nice Sichuan dishes myself instead.  But quickly came to terms and try to enjoy the outing and anticipated our meal and the our experience ended up as I've already mentioned above.  Dear reader's if you want dining experience, this is not a place for you.  Dear owner, please if you own a restaurant, don't run it like a cheap Chinese take out place.  Parisiennes do have higher expectations but if your aim is to serve tourist and close circle friends, what I've said is irrelevant to you maybe what you offer is good enough.","Sadly, Work of an Amateur...second attempt but both cases failed.",1,NONE,8747229

I cannot recommend Le Dôme in Paris based on our disappointing experience in December. From the moment we arrived, the service was subpar.

986597803,"My husband proposed to me some years ago at this restaurant.  We have been back a few times since then but not for a few years.  My husband booked this restaurant for my 60th birthday (18th December).  

Although the restaurant is still quaint and pretty, the experience was vastly different from our previous visits.  

We were given a disinterested ""You need to sit upstairs"" when we arrived and the service continued in a similar vein.  My husband was sent into the cellar to choose a bottle of wine.  He returned with the wine and it sat on our table for some time before a waiter came to open the bottle.  I ordered filet de boeuf (€35).  When it arrived it certainly wasn't a beef fillet.  It was a cheap, very flat cut of meat that had been cooked and folded over to give the appearance of a fillet .  It also had gristle in it.  The sparse vegetables that were provided were cold and the sauce was lukewarm.

My husband ordered beef cheeks and he also found his dish totally underwhelming.  He had to spit out a bit of gristle into a handkerchief.

At no point did the waiter ask us if our meal was okay.  I imagine he was reluctant to initiate the conversation because he was probably more than well aware that the food was not okay.  Given it was my 60th birthday we were not going to further ruin the evening with the unpleasantness of having to complain.  We cut the evening short, paid our bill after one course (€102) and left.  I actually couldn't wait to get out of there.

If, as others have suggested, this restaurant is in the habit of ripping off tourists, then the owners of Au Vieux Paris should be ashamed of themselves.  This is the only bad restaurant experience we had during our entire visit to Paris.

Much is made of the patrons Odette and Georges and their seasonal ingredients from the finest organic farms in the Aveyron.  The meal I was presented with on 18th December was nothing to proud of.  It was, in fact, an embarrassment.  I suggest Odette and Georges get back to basics and ensure ALL their guests receive the food and service they are paying for.

We stopped to take photos of it's charming facade when a man offered to take some for us, with us in them. Turns out it was the owner, and he offered us a peek inside the very historic building. Wow what a gobsmacker!
We booked for dinner and were treated to sensational meals around oddly shaped tables (which is great) downstairs.  It is a 'choose your own' cellar, so my husband went and picked what he wanted.   It is a VERY old building so don't ex[pect large open spaces or modern decor.  It was wonky, charming, and decorated to the max in florid french style.  Gorgeous.   I absolutely loved it.  The food was great, but the atmosphere and the fun and rambunctious owner really made the atmosphere the stand out.   People talk together, over tables, sit at tables together, or separately, it's very 'as you see it'.

Service was actually good. Water, bread with butter, attentive on wine and water refills, and English was spoken. No complaints about the service.

But the food was below average and the prices were expensive. In term of pricing, the prices were more like the tourist traps around Île Saint-Louis and the Louvre. 

All things considered, for a coffee or a glass of wine, Le Cafe Pierre would be an acceptable choice with good people watching. But it's not a place you should go for food.

It's not top end but a pleasant quick meal. More like a takeaway with a few tables but don't let that put you off. Greeted in a friendly manner and had the place to myself for a few minutes before a local couple turned up - obviously they had been before. 

Service was quick, friendly and the menu typical - pizza, pasta and a few meat dishes. 

I had a rocket salad with excellent homemade ciabatta. Then a pizza that was good. Followed by a coffee. Nespresso but fair enough. Would have been good to have a bottle of plain olive oil on the table. 

With a 25cl jug of the house red it came to less than €22. 

If you're on business with a limit to spend, this is a good place to go compared to some of the local bars\bistros. 

If you need a bit of Paris glitz then not the place to go. Otherwise a solid place for a reasonably priced meal. ",A good local place,4,Business,6224289

Once in, the (I assume) owner joked about our tardiness but then sat us. We ordered our wine and food, he proceeded to serve us our wine and then headed to the kitchen. After about 15 minutes we heard a somewhat loud noise from the kitchen and a few minutes after that the owner came out with a towel wrapped around his hand, saying he had cut it badly, needed to go to the hospital and couldn't serve us anything else. We left the 8 euro for the wine, and then left the restaurant. 

Just seconds after us leaving, the towel that was around his hand was off and he used his hand to open the door to the kitchen. He seemed to have faked the incident in order to refuse us service. 

Honestly my wife and I didn't care that much. We finished our wine, and we were feeling good. Sure it sucked having to go find somewhere else to eat, but the atmosphere in Le Bigado was not what we were looking for anyways and we eventually stumbled upon Scus'y which was a much better dinner experience.",Faked Injury to avoid serving us.,2,Couples,6224289

Whilst the service was friendly, I got a raised eyebrow or two for wanting to have my lunch alone. 

The quality of the food was not in line with the prices they charged. 

A basic avocado toast for € 9 (tasty, but small), followed by a basic bavette, an indistinct sauce (could have been industrial), with under-fried potato cubes (the oil must have been way too hot, they were almost raw inside, whilst getting crispy on the outside) topped with a few leaves of lettuce for € 34.

My colleague and I went there to meet a client at lunchtime. We orderered a drink and took a table for 4 on the terrace as there was going to be 3 of us. Lumbered with bags and laptops and notebooks, it was obvious we needed a bit of space. A waiter quickly came to ask us to move to a table for 2, when the rest of the terrace was empty (and it was a bank holiday... in a business area). We explained we were expecting someone else and after a quick chat he went away.
When our guest left, said waiter was quick to return to ask that we moved away to a small table. My colleague wanted to have lunch and indicated a small table would not suffice as she needed to work on her laptop and there would no place to put the food on the table. Said waiter was having none of it. We pointed out that there rest of the brasserie was empty (bank holiday in a business area) and it should not be any trouble if she stayed at the bigger table. No No, he was expecting lots of passing trade. We said we'd move should the brasserie be busy, but asked to stay until it became so...which of course was denied.

My partner and I had researched this place before we came and decided to visit due to the excellent reviews and for an early birthday meal on our first evening in Paris. 

Unfortunately, we were met with possibly one of the rudest waiters to ever walk this earth. 
He did not greet us, look at us or talk to us, until we asked if we could have a table for two (this was at around 9.45, last orders are at 10pm) he left us waiting for 10 minutes before telling us that there were no tables available and that we would have to sit at the bar. 
My partner pointed out that there were several tables empty. 
He gave us a very quick brief of the menu and seemed pretty annoyed that we couldn’t speak French, even though we apologised profusely for this. 

I ordered the chicken and my partner ordered the pork, both of which were pink in the middle... I asked if it was possible to have my chicken cooked a little more, which seemed a real inconvenience. 

We then asked for the bill to which he quite rudely threw it on the bar. 

To add insult to injury, the tables my partner previously pointed out were empty, remained empty all evening. We were made to feel like dogs in the corner, unable to sit with the rest of the customers, however we were expected to pay the same price as everyone else.

I speak for the hidden tasting section of the Golden promise. Probably more than 500 rare bottles of the finest Whiskeys are welcoming you and the tasting Master can advise you wisely to make a choice depending your taste or if you want to be surprised. He knows every bottle and the heritage of whiskey and rum. The place is designed for the pleasure of the tasting, focused on the liquors. Neutral smell in the basement, neutral taste of the water, chosen music not too loud. Prices are very different from the ""cocktail"" part of the bar but you will for sure certainly not have the same experience. Here, it's another step, you learn, you grow up, you go back home covered with a thin layer of gold... they warned you: golden promise!
You don't want to extract from this bubble out of the world, your mouth full of deep rare flavours, you happily goes up to surface in the 2 stores one dedicated to sake, the other to whiskey. You like to watch all those bottles extending those moments of grace you shared, your eyes sparkling when suddenly a growth voice barks at you STORE IS CLOSED! YOU MUST GO OUT! Your bubble is broken in half a second by a rude security man without manners nor education. We have put on the table enough money not to finish the experience that way. If stores are forbidden, please put screens to make a way to the door and put the security guy outside or better educate your employee to high end customers and code of luxury places.
Another comment: whiskey master was wearing a face mask and it's ok, even if I personally prefer to see the full face of people. In such place, if mask choose white masks instead of blue. If gloves choose coton white.

That said, I very highly recommend the place for the choice and the quality. Note one star is only because security guide broke our bubbles and the from nirvana we came down to frustration...

With only two NZ wines on the winelist (one pinot noir and one sav blanc, both from the same winery), and no NZ beer, and no kiwi decor or anything this was super disappointing. In addition, there was no vege food (no bar in New Zealand would offer a menu with nothing entirely vegetarian). How hard would it be to have a kiwi beer and not to have more wine from Chile than from NZ? We were very disappointed.

I really appreciated being able to book a table for brunch - it is rare in Paris but so helpful. Meanwhile the little terrace is so peaceful for eating.

Sadly the food didn't match this nice setting. The Granola and the avocado toast were nice enough, but weren't amazing. Meanwhile the dessert, which took nearly an hour to arrive because it was very busy, wasn't very good. 
The coffee was especially disappointing (and I was pretty shocked to hear the waitress try to explain that English breakfast and Earl Grey were two completely interchangeable teas).

980701810,"I’d been to L’Orangerie for dinner twice before my recent visit to Paris. At that time the chef was David Bizet who is now with L’Oiseau Blanc in The Peninsular. 

Since the restaurant was awarded 2 Michelin stars earlier this year and there’s a new chef, I decided to go there again. 

I’ve always loved the charming and intimate setting of the restaurant which is located in the glass paned extension of the courtyard of the George V Hotel.

As for the food, there’re a 5-course discovery menu and a 8-course tasting menu. None of them included any meat since chef Alan Taudon 
doesn’t use meat (at least for now). Since I wasn’t really hungry, I opted for the former.

It’s obvious a lot of efforts had been put into plating. Each dish was very pleasing to the eye. Even the cutlery and tableware were very tasteful and beautiful. Everything tasted very good. The ingredients were superb and the cooking was  healthy, light and precise. The menu was balanced and the food portions were just right. So I didn’t get very full in the end. 

The service was impeccable and what one normally expects from a 2-star restaurant and a 5-star luxury hotel. I didn’t feel like having alcohol and the very professional staff recommended to me a very good non-alcoholic cocktail (i.e. Do You Saint-Tropez). 

Highly recommended. Since there’re only about 7  to 8 tables, it’s advisable to book well ahead in order to avoid disappointment.",One of my best meals in Paris,5,Solo travel,10443323

To addressing every little need throughout the dinner. To delivering quite a surprise at the end. We felt quite spoilt. The service throughout the meal was impeccable and on par with what I've seen at places like EMP and Alchemist. As for the food, it was equally elegant in the presentation and the flavors. The space itself deserves a special mention – it is an ""Orangerie"", as the name suggests, so it is small and intimate, yet sophisticated and quite easy on the eyes.

The food was just as good the second time. I think going twice was maybe too much of a good thing but we really enjoyed the steak and it was so close to our Airbnb it felt like an easy choice since we knew what to expect second time around. Menu is quite bare in English. It doesn’t specify what comes with your steak for example so we had to ask and they were happy to substitute chips for potatoes which was good.

With a good mood and high expectations, we went there and ordered a set of oysters and a few other dishes, the waiter (a young guy) was very polite and very professional and helped us to put together our dinner. So, our first course was a set of different oysters. When we were almost finished eating them, I noticed a worm in one of them. YES, a very real worm, it was not a small worm, but a good fat worm. Our good mood immediately disappeared, my mom lost her smile, and at first I was even confused. I have visited a lot of restaurants in different countries, but this was the first time this happened to me. I called the waiter and showed him the worm, he was also surprised and took the plate to the kitchen. A few minutes later, another employee of the restaurant came up to us and somehow slurred and quickly said that it was normal and nothing terrible had happened, my mother wanted to tell him something, but for some reason he did not ignore her and just walked away. Then our waiter came back and also began to tell us that this often happens and that it is a sign of a fresh dish. We were very surprised, and I told him that even if it was indeed a ""sign of freshness"", I shouldn't have seen it in my dish anyway. The waiter replied that we would not be charged for this dish. 
In any case, this dinner could not continue in this establishment, the appetite and mood were lost. We were drinking wine with the set of oysters, so I asked for a check to pay for the wine, but when I saw the check I was surprised again, it contained this set of oysters. The administrator started telling me the same story that other employees had told me before, he spoke to me nervously and gave me the impression that it was my fault for finding the worm there. We argued with him for a long time, but luckily I didn't pay for those oysters, only for the wine. After this aggressive dialog, our evening with my mother was completely ruined. And the most important thing I want to note is that no one even apologized to us. Only the waiter who served us from the very beginning said that he was very sorry for what happened, and in front of us the administrator also aggressively said something to him in French, I felt sorry for that guy. I sincerely wish him strong nerves and good luck. The point of this situation is not even that I found a worm there and whether it's really normal or not, but the way we were treated there, the administration ruined our evening, our mood, and my gift to my mother.

Because I’d cycled over and had a bit of a chill, I decided to sit in the warm,  quiet interior.  I ordered a veggie burger, taking care to speak clearly and at an appropriate volume.

The restaurant bills itself as vegetarian friendly and I was at first astonished at how authentic the burger tasted.  I eyeballed it.  Juiceless, but it could have passed for meat or Beyond Meat,  to my eye.  After two more bites I spoke to the waiter and he said he’d thought I’d ordered cheeseburger.  He removed the plate and said he’d make a price adjustment.  I’m not sure if he asked if I’d would like to order something else or if I’d like to have what I ordered initially, but whatever either case may be, I declined.

After finishing the mediocre fries, I ordered  a tarte tatin  and found the restaurant’s  interpretation of that classic  much to my liking.

L’addition was not much to my liking, however.  The waiter had removed the side of frites from the total.  (It could be argued that a good waiter would have made certain I understood that the burger came with a garnish of fries, before adding that item; had I known, I would not have asked for it.)

Maybe he figured I was a tourist and taking responsibility for his mistake and garnering good  would produce no return.  Fact is, I’m a neighbour and they could have  had a repeat customer on their hands, rather than a lousy review on Trip Advisor.

I ordered the Rigatoni caccio e pepe, a signature offering of Epoca.   What I got was rigatoni drowned in a white sauce, covered with some grated chees as a few sprinkles of black pepper.  One always discovers variations on a recipe, but at Epoca a red line has been crossed.  What is served here is not caccio e pépé.  Rather it resembles macaroni and cheese  sauce out of a bottle and some ground pepper on top. 
 
Cacio e pepe on the other hand is made using egg pasta, like tonnarelli.  The sauce is a combination of lots of cracked (not ground) black pepper that is first grilled and then cooked in the pasta water into which peccorino-romano cheese is introduced slowly an whipped to produce a pepper sauce that just coats th tonnarelli.  It should be served directly from the pan.  None of these essential elements is present at Epoca.   Their offering lies outside the bounds of good taste, both literally and figuratively.

The Sicilian white wine was quite tasty, but the portion in my glass was minuscule.  Needless to say, the server showed up a few minutes later to ask if I wanted a 2nd glass..  Toward the end of the meal, the serveur reappeared and tried to take away my glass while there was still wine in it.

Salad tasted like a cole slaw with mostly shredded cabbage.  The maki tasted fine.  The meat on the sticks tasted so so.  One of them was a thin meat over melted cheese, the other was ham which was mostly fat, and there was a chicken stick and a meat ball stick.

The room is plain -- not fancy, but still quite lovely.  An open kitchen, and serious talent behind the stoves.  

I had a version of headcheese that was better than anything I'd had in my life - yeah it's that good, and unfortunately, I shared with my wife.  I would have wanted it all.

The main course was the special which was a duck wrapped around pork and foie gras, and it was frankly exceptional.  My wife had a lovely seafood plate.

Always low expectations on a cafe, especially one so close to a major attraction ( this is metres from Arc de Triomphe), but it was handy so here we go.

Onion soup to start - as French as Josephine’s knickers and it also went down well. 
The similarity to Guinness was initially disconcerting but the taste was superb.

On to mains and Hachis Parmentier - this is sadly often translated as “cottage pie” but it is most definitely not when done well. 
Here the chef served white clouds of mash struck through with lightning bolts of grilled cheese crisps. The conical bowl might suggest a deficiency of the meat but here the chef had a melting rich meat and gravy combination which really showed the difference between Hachis P and Cottage Pie, In Hachis Parmentier it is steered beef not minced beef which lies beneath the clouds and lines the stomach so well. 

On a roll and I opted for the Tarte Tartin- what else? 
A large slice with a side of cream, initially I worried that the coating on the tarte would be the now ubiquitous salted caramel, but nope- it’s perfect not too sweet toffee restraining the tart tart from being too much.

It started off ok, as the bar guy was nice and the waitress appeared to be nice when she greeted me. However, it all went downhill from there! First of all, after I ordered my food, I noticed small flies that wouldn’t leave my table. That is first sign of a dirty location. Next, I order my food and it comes with lint in it. Yes...lint from clothing, which I saw in my French fries and my omelet. Unfortunately the waitress never returned to my table, so I finished my wine and went to pay...without eating of course. So when the manager asked was everything ok, I was honest. I said no, and that I didn’t want to make a huge deal of it, but something was in my food. He sent the waitress over to check, she pulled off some lint from my fries and says “it’s only a little bit. It’s not a big deal and could have come from MY clothes, so I don’t understand why you didn’t eat”. Really?????? Seriously???? I am finding foreign objects in my food and YOU can’t understand why I wouldn’t eat it? I was so mad at that point. The next waitress says to me “if there was a problem you are supposed to say something when you get your meal and not at the end”. I agree for the most part with that, however, in this case I explained that my waitress never returned to my section, so I couldn’t tell her. Instead of waiting any longer, I just decided it was time to go! My original waitress came to me and said we will give you your 4€ glass of wine for free, but the food you have to pay for ...even though you didn’t eat it. Wow! I was even more pissed, because she added “you didn’t have to make such a big deal about something so small”. So so rude!!!!!! These people acted like I was trying to get a free meal. NO! I would have told them and asked them to remake my meal had the waitress ever returned initially! I didn’t ask for free wine and not did I expect it! I am more than pissed about the rude and condescending comments to me as a customer, as well as the way this place handled this situation. All they had to do was ask me what I wanted, and I would have asked them to remake my damn meal!!!!! I didn’t order lint as a seasoning! I am so disappointed that anyone in a food industry would ever suggest it’s not a big deal to eat a meal that has foreign things in it. It’s rude and they don’t know what allergies or anything a customer may have that whatever foreign item can affect them.

We ordered our drinks and a couple of appetizers to share.  First bummer: the ravioli was not available. We received the ceviche and hummus almost immediately. There were both quite bland, especially the ceviche which had just fish and tiny pieces of mango. No kick, no flavor, appalling!
The server told us to not rush the entrees order since they were pre-cooked and would be served very quickly. So it happened after we ordered them. The beef rendang, the chicken satay and the nasi goreng all look the same and had no flavor. The meat and the rice were dry and bland. Simply ridiculous!
The peak of our experience was when our server left (right after we received our entrees) to leave us alone with his bearded colleague at around 10.30 pm. We tried to order dessert but they were none available. Then the server started to put away the furniture from outside which made the temperature drop even more. He clearly told us we had to leave because he had to close the cash register at 11pm sharp, clean up and go to sleep to get back and open the place in the morning!

The cooking is vibrant, some dishes playing off traditional themes,  but all with an elegant and aesthetic touch.  The head male waiter, complained about in the Dec 2023 note below, is indeed ""correct,"" and not especially chatty,  but we not would describe his professional conduct as remotely rude.   It's a rather subdued and ""quiet conversation"" place, to be sure.

947540508,"After almost three weeks in Paris trying to find great places, I have hit the jackpot! This is now the poster child of my ""favorite French restaurant"".

We made reservations an obscenely long time ago, but many came in and were seated without them. But, we are old folks and we got there right when they opened at 7. If you want a later time, you need to plan ahead and reserve. Taking a taxi from the Opera district we arrived early while they were still closed and it started to pour. Rather than wait to the exact time, they were kind enough to open a couple minutes early to let folks in out of the rain. That already warmed my heart.

The hostess was warm, welcoming and we had an excellent seat at the window overlooking the Eiffel Tower. Shortly afterwards, we were greated by Jerome - the cook, owner, conductor, and wonderful person.

We had a bottle of Sancerre with the Menu Saveurs. This was beyond perfect. It varies every day, but ours was just brilliant. Everyone started with a white bean and fava amuse-bouche. I almost went thru the blinding flash at the end of ""Ratatouille"". It was small but so sublime as to recall every bean dish I have had. 

We then went thru a parade of dishes: an spring roll which was lovely; a tuna tataki; fois gras w/ biscuit; creamy risotto; a langoustine (which was almost like butter); the most perfectly cooked cod I have ever had (we discussed it at length); and, the most tender tenderloin I have had in many a moon. All of them well paced and perfectly sized. My dinner date & I each had different courses so we would only eat half of each & swap. It was a tough game making sure the other didn't cheat on carving out what half looked like.

Finally, the dessert course came. I sincerely believe we had the entire dessert tray. It was it's own tasting menu. We had so many options that I felt like I had fallen into Willy Wonka's dessert store. Each I would have considered a summit to a meal: rice pudding was devine; the lemon was AMAZING; biscuits with chocolate and a chocolate tray with a ganache / tart that brought a tear to my eye. It was so extravagant that the table beside us was asking which was what so they could order. 

If you are lucky enough to get in, I can assure you that you will not go away displeased. The staff were tremendous, the cooks were brilliant, the hostess kind and the owner, Jerome, a master of his domain.",Fantastic & Romantic Dinner,5,Couples,695062

895624788,"Incredibly disappointing and frustrating experience.  We had been eagerly anticipating our meal at Aida.  The reality was far from the expectation.  While the food was clearly of high quality, and very lovingly prepared, there was nothing exceptional about it.  The service was fine.  The experience was deeply disappointing.  The value was abhorrent.  From the moment we entered the room (an 8-person bar surrounding chef), the experience was frustrating.  Seated at the head of the bar was a bellicose man who spoke so loudly as to drown out the rest of our conversations, let alone our thoughts.  His conversational companion was the chef.  Perhaps, it was the opportunity to speak in his native tongue (Japanese) that emboldened chef to engage with this patron but, needless to say, chef rarely acknowledged the other five of us seated at the bar.  His descriptions (at least, to us) were haphazard and lacking.  The wait staff (which was hit-or-miss in terms of refilling our sake carafe) offered nothing special.  At some point, the aforementioned patron fell fast asleep; his dinner companion ate his full portions and did not bother to wake him up.  The food was very good, and of high quality.  By no means was it exceptional.  We left the meal hungry (desert was a measly five Rainer cherries, served in a glass, with nothing else).  If this had been a pop-up meal for €90, we would have likely felt like we discovered a neat little gem.  However, this was a €1000 meal, with a Michelin star.  We are annoyed.

Chef Aida is a creative genius that strives for perfection and you can see it always in the way he prepares food. If you watch the way he cuts and moves you can see a master in front of you. The food itself is simplicity at it's finest in the japanese way. I read some complaints here but I believe this is because those people do not understand what this type of food is all about. If you're looking for pretty plates and typical rich french food then this is not the place for you. If what you seek is simple perfection where the ingredients do the talking and the preparation and texture provides the soul then this is the place for you. One piece of advice, always go with the higher priced menu, it makes the world of difference and I believe Chef Aida uses this difference to weed out customers or customers that he does not want back. Only 9 servings per day, you can bet those seats are in high demand and each time I go I usually run across the same people.

The young operator can speak Vietnamese, French, English, Chinese and the menus and displays featured different languages, user friendly.  And he is friendly and helpful to boot.

Foodwise they are similar to competitors, setup market style display food that they either warm them if you eat in or you take back home/apartment and microwave them yourself.

As for noodles soups when you eat in they already have premade in a bowl just reheat in their oven and pour hot soup over it.  Honestly this place is not fine cuisine.

I had on both occasions the duck soup which has an entire 1/4 duck, and my wife had the prawn ravioli soup, full of prawn jaozi (dumplings).
The bowl of larzho (sweet hot chilli sauce) on the table is the best I have had outside China.

The place is packed with Asians, but they have an upstairs area as well as next door, so seating is no problem.

The jazz trio who played during our dinner were excellent and judged the set list and the performer well. 

My duck salad had too much Dijon mixed into the dressing which drowned out the other flavours whereas my partner’s mushroom tart was very good but lukewarm. Her main course of sea bass was drowned in a thick sauce plus her spinach side was lukewarm. My lamb chops were cooked raw when I asked for medium and the fat not properly rendered plus the sauce was thin and cold and the dauphinois potato was lukewarm and dry. I had to sent it back and they took my partners away as well. When they came back they had forgotten my partner’s spinach and whilst the lamb was cooked to medium the rest of the plate was still lukewarm and they forgot the spinach. They did offer us a free desert to compensate for the poor food but whilst grateful we declined as we are not desert fans.

It was a great night, totally worth it: we chose the Millesime menu (a 5-course menu, including cheese and dessert) with wine pairing and we never had so much fun in pairing. In fact, it was a blind tasting: the sommelier served us each  wine without saying anything about it. We had the time to smell it, to taste it, to pair it with its food, and to think about which grape/wine it could be. Then, by the end of each course, the sommelier came back to us, investigated our impressions and finally revealed which wine we tasted. 
We learned so much along this journey and it will definitely be a memorable experience!
Next time we’ll be in Paris, we’ll surely visit them again, to discover new wines and have another great night!

Their customer service quality and attention to detail was out of this world. Our rooms were ready before 3pm which was fantastic and we were offered a delicious coffee and pastries after we mentioned how tired we were after traveling all night. We got a family room which is basically one main door with two independent rooms inside, so as a teen she was delighted to have her own room all to herself. After opening the door she had a beautiful tray with a mini bottle of champagne, truffles and macarons and a Happy Birthday card, she was delighted.
I’m the kind of person who checks the room up and down, right and left and check that everything is as I expect it to be. I have to say EVERYTHING was Perfect! Beds extremely comfortable, showers amazing, towels oh I already miss those towels and another good thing is that the toilet and shower are separated  (inside the room) which is a plus. Saleh learned what our preferences were for breakfast on day 1
and afterwards we didn’t have to say a word, we’ll have our breakfasts ready every morning. I (unfortunately) hurt my leg and couldn’t walk properly and Rasy got me
a cane so I could use it and  keep going on with our trip. We stayed in La Tamise for 6 nights and the 6 were wonderful.
Thanks so much RASY AND SALEH, for everything, your extra attention to detail, recommendations and help are very much appreciated!

We ordered the Beef Luc Lac and the Poulet Agathe, asking for both to be extra spicy, along with some beer. The dishes were perfectly flavored and spiced. The service was outstanding even though they git very busy very quickly with a large party.

We were tempted to come back for lunch the next day and try the other dishes on the menu but we had other commitments that made it difficult to squeeze in.

This restaurant is a gutsy move by someone who used to be a food critic, Bruno Verjus. It is Carraige us to open a haute cuisine place and subject yourself to other critics.

Generally, I would say that he has succeeded : the dishes are creative and well prepared, and the service is impeccable.

Bruno Bruno himself, greets guests upon arrival and loves to chat with everyone which gives it a nice atmosphere and friendly touch.

However, there are still a couple of areas for improvement. For example, his lentil risotto was slightly disappointing because you could not taste the essence of the lentils. Instead, it is compensated with other flavors and that’s a shame for anyone who wants to put the product first. Also, in our tasting menu, there was a tendency to undercook the food or even serve it raw and then compensate with some other flavoring, which is a shame because you don’t get the full essence of some of the fish or seafood.

Final comment is about the prices which are absurdly high. This means of course you can’t come here for tasting menu on a regular basis and you even have to think twice for any meal at Table.

888912113,"Bruno, in my opinion, is one of the most inspired chefs in the world - and his restaurant, despite having received two Michelin stars, is vastly under appreciated.  Table should be mentioned alongside the well-known great restaurants in France. 

Table provides TRULY CREATIVE food that also manages to be delicious. Chef Bruno plays with flavors and concepts in a way that brings the patron to the origin of each ingredient.  Words do not do this place, or this man, justice.  The food needs to be experienced.  

The setting is a small bar-like environment, which still provides privacy between dining groups, due to clever architectural design.  An open kitchen is where the feast occurs for the eyes: a laboratory, an operating room, an orchestra.  

The knowledgeable and engaging staff round out the experience, each with a distinct and welcome persona.  Poetic descriptions of each dish, and thoughtful wine pairings throughout. 

And, all along, Chef is omnipresent. Overseeing his exemplary team, while he mingles with diners, popping back behind the bar occasionally to participate in the action. His bigger than life personality is felt in every moment of this epic experience.

Four of us wandered in to get directions for another venue, but we we’re so taken with the friendliness and charm of Mario that we decided to stay for dinner.

This is a small, cozy mom ‘n pop restaurant with a fine chef in the kitchen, presumably Monica, the wife of Mario.  Unlike most Italian restaurants, the recipes are neither southern (read Naples and Rome) nor northern (read Bologna and Florence), but Sicilian, different from both.

Long story short, my wife and I shared a nice portion of lasagna – flavored with a mild, pink sauce – that she pronounced the best she’s ever had.  I couldn’t argue with her.  The other lady then stated that her veal cutlet was the best that SHE ever ate.  Well, now.   
Her husband did not say a word, but steadily consumed a large plate of pasta until it was clean.

The burrata was excellent; we shared that as well.   The wine pours were very fair, and service was prompt.

After dinner, our host handed out teeny-tiny glasses of Marsala for a sweet finish.   I think we had dessert but can’t remember, c’est la vie.

Their premise is to serve meatless burgers by replacing the meat with eggs. There is, however, the option of adding a smashed burger patty inside. Having had my fair share of burgers in France, at Round Egg Buns, this is the closest I have come to a traditional good old-fashioned American hamburger.

Don't let the egg fool you. It doesn't overpower the overall taste of the burger and goes very well with all the other ingredients. The buns are made out of potato starch and are much lighter and fluffier than regular ""bread"" buns. You also have the possibility of making a DIY burger to your taste.

Their fries are home-made and extremely crispy.

I will definitely make this a go-to place every time I come back to Paris.

Ended up getting the mussels appetizer (without shells) with broccoli and cheese, served in this amazing sauce.  The banquette was the perfect thin crisp shell and soft inside -  did not get another one on this trip with this kind of quality.  We wondered if they made it on site?

Also the poitrine et mignon de cochon abricots haricots rouge aubergine [pork with apricots, red beans, and eggplants].

Nine days of lunching and dining at top-rated restaurants all over the city, and this cozy space was by far our favorite...and, after having lunch there, the only one we returned to for dinner. Very small and very special family-owned and run (4 represents the owners and their two children). Award-winning Chef Stephane Browne is a maestro of fresh, seasonal, local, and inspired ingredients. We savored each perfect dish and compilation of flavors and textures that could not have been more harmonized yet unique--not a single ""wrong"" note.

Personal, professional, generous service from wife and co-owner Emily (my spelling may be incorrect) and our evening waiter (Damien, if I heard correctly)--like friends who just happen to be world-class restaurateurs! The wine list and suggestions, too, were superb. The menu changes daily and is written on a chalkboard that is presented to each table--always  a good sign. We wanted MORE than one of everything. You simply cannot go wrong, especially when the prices are so reasonable and the fare so transcendent! We had just spent two months in Italy and asked if we could ""share"" our two main selections as a multi-course meal (antipasti, primi, secondi...). They not only said, ""Of course!"" but prepared separate beautiful half-portion plates for each of us. We swooned over not only the starters and main dishes but the wine by the glass, and then a bottle of wine, and then dessert--all for less than what we had paid at much ""ritzier"" eateries.

Four of us had the encornets poelées (squid)  in a perfect green sauce, which we sopped up with the excellent bread. Then three of us had the Saint Jacques (scallops) and one had the Lotte  (monkfish.) The cooking was just right, and the Anjou de Breuil white wine (a blend of sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, and chenin blanc) was the perfect accompaniment. For dessert, we shared one panna cotta and one ""chocolate cake,"" (actually a fondant of chocolate or a flourless cake.) We almost didn't order it because the server called it ""gluten-free,"" but it was gluten-free merely because it had no flour. It was perfect for any lover of chocolate, and the panna cotta was enjoyed by those who like panna cotta. The service is slow because it's a small restaurant with about 35 seats and one server. If you don't like  high top tables, specify that you prefer une table basse (normal dining hight) when you reserve. One word of caution: the after-dinner grappa offered in an over-sized bottle is not offerte; it costs 8€ a glass and is VERY strong.

956941164,"My wife and I went to the magnificent Impressionism exhibition at the Musée d'Orsay - if you get chance, go. It's a once in a lifetime experience. Anyway we left just after 2pm and saw this brasserie just around the corner. We sat indoors, the waiter came over and I had almost forgotten and given up in meeting a wonderful professional waiter, this was he. he missed nothing, saw everything, worked quickly, had a word, mad a few jokes, big smile, hugely efficient. We ordered a beer each, then ordered mains. I had the entrecôte and fries - they were the best fries I have had, ever, the steak was really good and cooked to how I asked for it (à point). My wife's was equally good. Half way through I asked our waiter as he busily went by for two glasses or red wine. They appeared within 30 seconds. Afterwards we asked if it was possible to have créme brûlée. He looked at the clock as it was after normal time for anything other than the one ones he had listed and he said, 'sure'. he came back with them 10 minutes later, perfect. We had coffee afterwards - very good. 
I note some of the negative comments, mostly from tourists who have no idea or think they are entitled to make free use of the toilet facilities or take up a table only to order 'free' water. Americans seem to be the worst. They certainly were at the Musée d'Orsay, shoving their phones in front of you so they can take a photo or put themselves in front of paintings to have their photo taken as they pouted like a fish.

My favourite dish was the burgers they served with the Indian touch and biryani as well . Though i have tried almost everything in the menu coz i was there almost everyday ..

But, then came the main course; i wont even give you the indian name as in fact all it was was poor quality, pre cooked chicken pieces in a factory made, in-descriptive, curry sauce.  No herbs or spices could be detected visually!  Less effort in food preparation would be difficult to achieve.  Im guessing that the quality of indian food must be pretty poor, in general, for a restaurant to get away with this.  At my request they recooked the plate: basically added a few bits of onion and pepper but this made no difference.

Overall, we were quite impressed with the sincere effort put forward by the students providing our table service.  They were all very polite and dressed professionally as you would expect in a fine-dining restaurant. The food was pricey as one would expect as long as the food quality is exceptional; fortunately, food served was very good with one exception.  The L'amuse buche was well prepared and quite tasty.  The foie gras de canard was very tasty and was served with a nicely toasted piece of pain de brioche.  The Noix de St. Jaques (scallops) were tasty but were unfortunately over-cooked which reduced their size and changed their texture from tender to chewy.  To end our lunch, three table of various dessert choices were rolled out for our selection – all were quite tasty and rich; however, all could be improved if made with less sugar.  Atmosphere inside was uncomfortable because there was a large table filled with employees from a nearby office that were quite loud making it difficult to hear the wait-staff and talk with one another.

Overall, although quite pricey, we had a very good lunch experience at Vatel which could have been excellent had the scallops been cooked properly and had the noise level been significantly reduced without the loud and boisterous table of office employees in our same room.",Pricey but tasty lunch with excellent service,4,Family,2702948

All the persons I talked to acted like real well-trained professionals. The cooking was greatly executed. The advises for wines were always adequate, and the timing of service was so perfect I never had to ask for a waiter to come to my table.

The setting of the place is also a big plus. It has the charm of prestigious establishments, without making you uncomfortable or not fitted for this kind of milieu.

There were other tables to the side for smaller groups and the bar had about 6 stools facing their large rhum selection. 

As for the food, I would go for their burgers with their homemade chips and their mayo which they obviously make themselves. The wine won't break your wallet but avoid having too many shots if you didn't eat enough beforehand.

The atmosphere was warm and welcoming although I wish there was a tight squeez after a while. There is only one toilet so after a while, people waiting would chat with you if you were sitting next to the bar which was amusing. They had a great playlist going and the guys would be chatting or joking around with each other. It was as if you were at a frat house party. The service was attentive and one of them remembered my name plus tried to speak to me in English when he found out I was American to put me at ease.

They have the worst house wine we’d tasted in Europe, witch is sad as Fance have a lot of suppliers for good house wine. Than they have the worst pizza guy we ever see.

Our advice: look for the night standard products and try to get a proper cooking and pizza guy. There is a lot of good professionals in south Italy available to move Paris. It’s easy to get one good guy to make appropriate Italian Pizza.

We were told to choose a main course only as the restaurant would ""surprise"" us with the starter. That makes picking a wine quite difficult, but we were intrigued as to what this surprise was.

It turned out to be six different starters, all of which were brought to the table at once. They were bizarre: a celeriac and crab combo; jerusalem artichokes and some unidentified cubes of meat; broccoli with passion fruit; some prawns and whelks; a slab of pate that you could have built a house from and one other that I've forgotten. It was WAY too much food for two people and we left a good part of it uneaten; partly because we didn't like it and parlty because it was just too much. This is a completely pointless waste of food.

The piece of beef that I ordered for the main course was well cooked but it came with two sauces that didn't go with the meat or with each other.

We went on a quiet Tuesday evening, so initially there were few other diners (we arrived 19:30) but it soon filled up, and it's easy to understand why.
Service was excellent, very attentive but not overboard, and the food choices are not too lengthy, which i always like.
We had the set entrees, which were simply wonderful - 6 small plates to share but plenty of food, and the combinations were different and wonderful. 
My main was lamb with aubergines and aubergine puree, wonderfully tasty and the lamb cooking was perfect, soft, pink and tasy. My wife had scallops with artichokes which was fragrant and wonderful.
Wines were priced by the glass and there was plenty of choice - i had the Chablis which was perfect (even with the lamb).
Desserts were another sharing set of 8 different small pieces and they were again wonderful - a gooey chocolate cake, millefoile and a lovely little tiramisu, plus others.
All in all this was a wonderful visit, at a very resonable price, and one i will remember for a long time.

983010614,"I came back here after 4 years as I had really good remember of this place the first time. 
Our grilled vegetables served with some bread on the side as Antipasto were good and simple. 
The pizzas seemed a bit undercooked this time. 
The mozzarella wasn’t melted properly and the toppings were little cold. 
I had  Capricciosa pizza 🍕. The ham on it was far too much!!!!! 
Also they use synthetic wood 🪵 so there is no authentic flavour in the pizza. 
Generally ok but I wont replay go back and I would like to try different pizzas places in Paris.
The tiramisu’ 👎🏻, looks like to be homemade. 
Service ok, they can do better.

A group of six went today for a typical French meal and we were not disappointed.  From the beginning the owner was attentive, friendly and polite.

957444176,"Such an ordinary meal!  Very surprised by the glowing reviews. An eggplant parmesan that was no better than a frozen meal from a supermarket, burned around the edges, tough skin difficult to cut through, rubbery cheese, and hot enough to burn the tongue as well. Baked until burned and then microwaved later is my guess. Salad next to it on the plate wilted from the contact.  The other diner had the most bland, unadorned cod ever seen, no garnish at all, flavorless sauce.  Entrees were better, simple salmon ceviche and stracciatella with tomatoes and pesto, but both were really more cafe quality than restaurant. Cigarette smoke from those eating outdoors came inside with the breeze and added to the disappointment.",Not so good,2,Couples,17727441

The ""chocolate rose"" dessert was one of the best things I've ever eaten. They have a short but interesting wine list which the owner was happy to explain.

I was disappointed, I had the okonomiaki to which they added strips of bacon which made it difficult to eat because you eat with chop sticks and you can't cut. I found the bacon to spoil the dish as I prefer a more classical taste, this dish lacked flavour. My friend had the Soba with duck, the duck was too chewy and also tasteless like a poor quality meat. 
When we got there, about noonish, on a Tuesday, I thought there would be a line and a wait. I was surprised based on the popularity of the restaurant not to found more of a crowd. Maybe not worth the hype.",Not that good,2,Friends getaway,1007574
